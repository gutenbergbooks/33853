<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>ON THE CANYON TRAIL.</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there! What in the name of reason is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>The horseman&#8217;s excited cry was echoed by a startled
neigh from his beast, which wheeled about so suddenly
that he nearly precipitated both himself and rider into
the gulch below.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m sorry<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>Hold on, Zu! Go! Do, please.
Quick! It&#8217;s so narrow just beyond and I can&#8217;t<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger obeyed, perforce, for his spirited animal
having now headed up the slope, continued on his
course at breakneck speed, pursued at equal pace by
the unknown creature that had terrified him.</p>

<p>The race would not have been so even had the trail
been wider, for King Zulu could easily have beaten his
contestant, but, as it was, the fleeing bay bruised his
master&#8217;s leg against the canyon wall, now and then,
while bits of the bird&#8217;s plumage were torn on the same
projecting rocks. There was no point of passage till
more than a mile higher on the mountain, and Jess
knew this if Mr. Hale did not. He knew nothing save
that he was clinging and riding for his life, and that
this &#8220;Western horseback tour&#8221; which his doctor had
prescribed for him, seemed now more likely to prove
his death than his cure.</p>

<p>But when a laugh rang out, close to his shoulder, he
turned his head and glanced angrily backward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>&#8220;Oh, I beg your pardon, but&#8211;it&#8217;s so funny! I&#8217;ve
often wanted to try King Zu against a strange horse
and now I have. Only, if we were up there on the
mesa, he&#8217;d show you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does this trail never end, nor turn?&#8221;</p>

<p>The laughter on the girl&#8217;s face changed to anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not ill, exactly; only I&#8217;m not experienced at this
business and it shakes me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ride too hard and stiff. That&#8217;s why. Let
yourself go&#8211;just be part of your horse. He&#8217;s a beauty,
isn&#8217;t he? Even the boys couldn&#8217;t stand that gait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you. Who taught you to ride an ostrich?
Where did you get it? It&#8217;s almost the first one I ever
saw and quite the first that Prince did. I was nearly
as scared as he, meeting such a creature on a lonely
mountain trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never learned&#8211;it just happened. Zulu is &#8216;patriarch&#8217;
of the flock. The only imported bird left alive.
We just grew up together, he and I. Didn&#8217;t we,
King?&#8221;</p>

<p>Speech was now easier, for the speed of both animals
had slackened, that of Prince to a comfortable trot.
While the sidewise lurching motion of the ostrich was
enjoyable enough to Jessica, it turned Mr. Hale&#8217;s head
dizzy, watching. Or it may have been the blinding sunshine,
beating against the canyon wall and deflected
upon the riders in waves of heat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! This is scorching. How far, yet?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica saw that what she minded not at all was
turning the stranger sick, and answered swiftly:</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be able to get further than &#8216;five
times&#8217; before we reach the turn. There&#8217;ll be a glorious
breeze then. There always is.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8216;five times&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, just the multiplication table. I always say it
when I&#8217;ve something I want to get over quick. You
begin at one-times-one, and see if it isn&#8217;t so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we find at the top; your home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, indeed. That is quite the other way.
Down in the valley. Sobrante ranch. That&#8217;s ours.
Were you going there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was going&#8211;anywhere. I had lost my way.
&#8216;Missed the trail,&#8217; as you say in this country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought, maybe, you were just a &#8216;tourist.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale laughed, and the laugh helped him to
forget his present discomfort.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I am, even if you do speak so disdainfully.
Are all &#8216;tourists&#8217; objectionable?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s brown cheek flushed. She felt she had said
something rude&#8211;she, whose ambition it was to be always
and everywhere &#8220;Our Lady Jess,&#8221; that the dear
&#8220;boys&#8221; called her. But she remembered how annoyed
her mother was by the visits of strangers who seemed
to regard Sobrante and its belongings as a &#8220;show&#8221; arranged
for their special benefit.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8211;we are generally glad when the rains come,&#8221;
she answered, evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;To keep them away? Yet if, as I suspect, you have
an ostrich farm, I can&#8217;t blame their curiosity. I&#8217;m
hoping to visit one, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ours is not a real &#8216;farm.&#8217; It is just one of the
many things our ranch is good for. But I know my
mother would make you very welcome. You&#8211;but
there! Look down, please. Yonder it is, Sobrante.
That means &#8216;richness,&#8217; you know. And now up. The
next turn will land us on the mesa, and I hope, I hope,
I have come in time!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>The road had now broadened, and with a little chirrup
to King Zulu, she passed and forged ahead so
rapidly that she was soon out of sight. The great bird
upon whose back she was perched was not, apparently,
at all wearied, but poor Prince was utterly winded,
while a curious feeling of loneliness stole upon his
rider.</p>

<p>But, presently, the sound of voices came over the
bluff, and Mr. Hale urged his tired beast forward. The
next he knew he was sprawling on the plateau and his
horse had fallen beside him. Prince&#8217;s forefoot was in
a hole, from which he was unable to withdraw it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! oh! The poor creature! And you, sir, are
you hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I think not. Rather a shake-up, though, and
I was dizzy with the heat before. Prince, Prince, lie
still; we&#8217;ll help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>One glance had showed the stranger that they were
near a shepherd&#8217;s hut, and that its occupant was at
home. The man had been sitting quietly in the shade
of the little building and of the one pepper tree which
grew beside its threshold. He did not move, even now,
till the girl called impatiently:</p>

<p>&#8220;Pedro! Come! Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he arose in a leisurely fashion and, carefully
depositing his osiers in a tub of water, came forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;So? He can&#8217;t get up, yes? A wise man looks
where he rides, indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite his anxiety over Prince, Mr. Hale regarded
the shepherd with amused curiosity. Pedro&#8217;s swarthy
face was as unmoved as if the visits of strangers with
disabled horses were daily events; but the man&#8217;s calmness
did not prevent his usefulness. In fact, during
every step of his deliberate advance he had been studying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
the situation and how best to aid the fallen animal,
which had now ceased to struggle and lay gazing
at his master with a dumb, pitiful appeal.</p>

<p>Then Pedro bent forward and, with a strength amazing
in a man of his small build, seized Prince&#8217;s head
and shoulder and with one prodigious wrench freed
him from the pitfall. Then he stooped again and carefully
examined the bruised forefoot.</p>

<p>&#8220;A moon and a half he&#8217;ll go lame. Yes. For just
so long let him be left with Pedro. Si?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he led the limping beast toward the hut and
began to bathe its injured ankle with the water from
the tub.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marvelous! I never saw anything done as easily
as that!&#8221; cried Mr. Hale, recovering from his astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah; but you&#8217;ve never seen our Pedro before. And
to think I was so angry with him, I!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a remorseful impulse Jessica sprang forward
and threw her arms about the old shepherd&#8217;s shoulders.
He received her caress as calmly as he did everything
else, though a keen observer might have seen a
fleeting smile around his rugged lips.</p>

<p>Smiles did, indeed, spring to all three faces when, a
moment later, the rattling of tins discovered Zulu
rummaging a heap of empty cans, even in the very act
of swallowing a highly decorated one.</p>

<p>The jingling startled Prince, also, from the repose
into which he had now settled, and, after one terrified
glance toward his unknown enemy, King Zu, he
dashed across the mesa as if lameness were unknown.</p>

<p>At which Pedro smiled, well content.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. He that uses his own legs spares his neighbors.
Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span>&#8220;Meaning that he would have to be exercised by
somebody?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shepherd did not answer. He had lived alone so
long amid the great solitudes of nature that speech had
grown irksome to him. He regarded it a sin to waste
words, and his young mistress understood this, if Mr.
Hale did not. To this gentleman the situation presented
itself as a very serious one. There was no habitation
visible save the small hut, a place barely sufficient
to its owner&#8217;s simple needs and utterly inadequate
to those of a lately recovered invalid. He was not
strong enough to make his way to the valley on foot,
and even if Prince were now able to carry him, he felt
it would be brutal to impose so hard a task.</p>

<p>But Jessica came to his aid with the suggestion:</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ll come and rest behind the cabin I&#8217;ll make
you a cup of coffee on Pedro&#8217;s little stove. He often
lets me when I come up to see him, and then, when
you&#8217;ve rested, we&#8217;ll go home. I am so angry I can
hardly breathe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed; I should never have guessed it,&#8221; he answered,
laughing, and allowing the girl to lead him to
the shelter proposed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but I am. And a gentlewoman never gets
angry. Least of all with such a darling as Pedro. You
see, he ought to have been about dying, and he hasn&#8217;t
even a single ache!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What an odd child you are!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I?&#8221; regarding him gravely. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t
want to be that. I want to be just&#8211;perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale sighed as he dropped upon the bench to
which Jess had guided him. &#8220;We are none of us that&#8211;ever.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s because &#8216;none of us&#8217; ever try quite
hard enough. But I will be, if trying will fetch it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she whisked inside the hut and presently there
came to the gentleman&#8217;s nostrils the aroma of freshly
steaming coffee. He had not realized that he was
hungry, but now could scarcely wait until the little
maid came out to him again with a tin cup of the liquid
in one hand and a can of condensed milk in the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother always lets her guests &#8216;trim&#8217; their
drink for themselves, but I&#8217;ll drop in the cream if you&#8217;ll
say how much. Enough? Now sugar. One? How
queer. And it&#8217;s sugar of our own making, too; beet
sugar, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tin cup was decidedly rusty, the cheap spoon
dingy, and &#8220;canned&#8221; milk the aversion of Mr. Hale&#8217;s
dyspeptic stomach; yet despite these facts he had never
tasted a more delicious draught than this, nor one
served with a gentler grace. For Jessica was quite
unconscious that there was anything amiss with Pedro&#8217;s
dishes, and now offered the stranger a tin of time-hardened
biscuits, with the air of one proffering the
rarest of dainties.</p>

<p>&#8220;You would better eat one of these; they&#8217;re quite
fine, with the coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll&#8211;I&#8217;ll try, thank you, if you&#8217;ll fetch your own cup
and sit beside me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Only I&#8217;ll have to wait till Pedro&#8217;s finished.
There&#8217;s only this and the egg, you know. He&#8217;s
rather stubborn, dear fellow. My mother has offered
him more dishes, but he says &#8216;more care&#8217; and won&#8217;t
take them. Excuse me.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a dip and swirl of her short skirts, the little
hostess ran into the hut, to reappear, a moment later,
bearing in both hands a drinking-cup which made the
guest exclaim in delight:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>&#8220;What an exquisite thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it? But just wait until you see those which
Pedro made for mother! This is fine, but they&#8217;re like
cobwebs.&#8221;</p>

<p>She did not offer to show him the cup more closely,
for she had seen the shepherd lay down his rushes and
sit waiting, and Jessica would not disappoint the old
friend for the new. Still the less, because she had so
lately been vexed with him, and wholly without cause.</p>

<p>But when the silent fellow had emptied the cup she
proudly gave it for Mr. Hale&#8217;s inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;An ostrich egg, you see, cut off at the top. Pedro
wove all this lacelike outside, of just the common tule
rushes. He splits them till they are like threads, and
see that handle! Nothing could break it, nor can one
tell just where it begins or ends&#8211;the joinings, I mean.
There are many wonderful weavers among the Indians,
but none so deft as our Pedro, my mother says.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, will you not fill this again and drink it with
me? For I see that our speechless friend, yonder, has
gone to work again as if his life depended on his industry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s always at work, like that. Yet he never
neglects his flock. He has been herding ever since he
was a little boy. That must have been years ago. He&#8217;s
so very old.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look it. I should guess he might be
fifty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fifty! Why, there&#8217;s nobody anywhere around who
remembers when our Pedro was born. Not even Fra
Mateo at the mission, yet even he is more than a hundred,&#8221;
she answered, proudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Possible? Well, this is all wonderful to me who
have lived always in a crowded city. This big West
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
is like a romance, a fairy tale; not the least of its marvels
to find a little girl like you riding alone on such
a steed up such a desolate canyon, yet not in the least
afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, why should I be afraid? Except, of course,
I was, for a bit, when I saw that Zulu made your horse
rear. A step nearer and you&#8217;d have both gone over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale shuddered, and Jessica hastened to add:</p>

<p>&#8220;But the step wasn&#8217;t taken and you&#8217;re quite safe up
here. Is the dizziness all gone? Many are like that
before they get used to the glare. Some of the &#8216;tourists&#8217;
wear blue glasses, and veils, and things. They look
so funny.&#8221;</p>

<p>Into her laughter burst Pedro&#8217;s speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Ware Antonio. Is it plucking day, no? His third
hand is Ferd, who lies and steals. I know. The mistress&#8217;
chest has many openings. <i>Nina</i>, go home, and
bid Antonio come himself when next he&#8217;d have me die.
Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica sprang to her feet. These were many words
for the shepherd to utter, and was not to be disobeyed.
Though the old man&#8217;s age was doubtless far less than
was accredited him, he was commonly considered a
sage whose intelligence increased, rather than diminished,
with the passing years.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go at once, Pedro. Please forget that I was
angry and&#8211;good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale was unprepared for this sudden departure,
which bereft the scene of its fairest feature; for even
while he listened to the brief speech between this odd
pair there was a flash of twinkling feet and a scarlet
Tam, and Jessica was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;why&#8211;what? Eh, what?&#8221; he demanded, rising.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>His answer came with a crash and clatter which
could never have been made by one small, fleeing figure,
and with the startling force with which everything happened
on that eventful day.</p>

<p>Over the bluff scrambled a shaggy piebald burro,
from whose back there tumbled at the stranger&#8217;s very
feet a brace of little lads, securely lashed together;
even their wrists and ankles bound beyond possibility
of their own undoing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horrors! Indian captives!&#8221; cried the gentleman,
aghast.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span><a id='link_2'></a>CHAPTER II<br /><span class='h2fs'>A BAD BUSINESS.</span></h2>

<p>Captives? Far from it&#8211;save to their own reckless
disregard of life and limb, and all for a bit of hitherto
untested fun.</p>

<p>Shrieking with laughter at the success of their experiment,
they rolled and floundered on the ground, till
the laughter changed to cries of pain as their restless
writhings to and fro drove their self-inflicted bonds
deeper into the flesh.</p>

<p>By some dexterity they got upon their feet, at last,
and one implored:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you Pedro! or you, man! Cut us loose, can&#8217;t
you? Don&#8217;t you see we can&#8217;t do it ourselves?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale adjusted his eyeglasses and looked rather
helplessly toward the shepherd; but that phlegmatic
person was working away on his wonderful basket as
stolidly as if there was none beside himself upon the
mesa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you hateful old Pedro! Cut us free, I tell you!
Ain&#8217;t I your master? You&#8217;d do it mighty quick for
&#8216;Lady Jess.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The frightened little fellow, whose fun had now
ebbed into a terrible fear of an indefinite bondage, began
to whimper, and Mr. Hale to act. A few sharp
slashings of the horsehair thongs and the captives were
free to express their delight in a series of somersaults,
which were only arrested by sight of Prince in the distance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
holding up his injured foot and seeking for some
pasture amid the dry herbage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! That horse is new. Is he yours, mister?
What&#8217;s the matter with him? Humph! I guess you&#8217;re
new, too, aren&#8217;t you? I never saw you in our valley
before. Where&#8217;s your ranch?&#8221;</p>

<p>The questioner was a blue-eyed, fair-haired little
chap whose close resemblance to Jessica proclaimed
him her brother; but he was younger, sturdier, and less
courteous than she. Yet his prolonged stare at the
stranger had less of rudeness than surprise in it, and
Mr. Hale laughed at the frank inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;You look rather &#8216;new&#8217; yourself, my man. About
eight years, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you guess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lads of my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Several thousand miles away, over the Atlantic
coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you fetch &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! couldn&#8217;t you? H-m-m.&#8221; Then he turned his
attention to Pedro, with the remark: &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you
sick, like &#8217;Tonio said? Making my sister come way up
here for nothing. Don&#8217;t you dare do that again, I tell
you. You&#8217;re just as well as ever, and I smell coffee.
Come on, Luis!&#8221;</p>

<p>Catching his mate around the shoulders the boy
rushed into the hut, only to be as promptly banished
from it. With a swiftness matching the children&#8217;s own,
the shepherd had followed and caught the pair, a lad
in either hand, and flung them out of doors, exactly as
one might a couple of mischievous kittens. Evidently,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
what was permissible to &#8220;Lady Jess&#8221; was forbidden
these, though they were not at all disturbed by their
sudden ejection. Such incidents were too familiar,
and, having landed in one heap upon the ground, they
immediately fell to wrestling as if this were the business
they had originally intended. Now the black head
of Spanish Luis was uppermost, now the sunnier one
of Ned, with a flying jumble of vari-colored hands
and feet, till Pedro came out and offered to each contestant
a cup of cold, but well-sweetened coffee.</p>

<p>This meant instant truce and they carried their treat
to the bench Mr. Hale had occupied, leaving him to
stand or sit upon the ground, as he preferred. He
chose the latter and near enough to hear their eager
chatter, which was still full of indignation against the
shepherd&#8217;s robust health.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cause he ought to been dead, &#8217;most. And my
mother wanting Jess the worst ever was. &#8217;Cause Wun
Lung cut hisself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe Wun Lung die now, maybe,&#8221; suggested
Luis, with hopeful heartlessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! No, he won&#8217;t. Chinamen don&#8217;t. You
never saw one, Luis Garcia. Hi! Look at Zulu. Hi!
Keno, Keno, Keno! Oh, Wow!&#8221;</p>

<p>By a mutual impulse, Prince and the ostrich had put
as wide a space between themselves as possible, and
the latter had strolled close to Pedro&#8217;s quiet flock before
he had perceived it. This was evident, even from
the distance; but now up rose Keno, the collie, and with
angry yelps rushed fearlessly upon the great bird.</p>

<p>King Zulu hesitated but an instant before he turned
his back upon his assailant and made all speed over
the bluff into the canyon below.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>&#8220;Well, of all cowards! A creature that could have
killed the dog with one kick of his foot!&#8221; cried Mr.
Hale, amazed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! No, he couldn&#8217;t. Kill you or Pedro. Kill
that old horse of yours, easy as scat. Can&#8217;t kick low
down as Keno. Huh! Guess I know more about
ostriches than you do,&#8221; exulted Ned, in whose opinion
the stranger had now greatly fallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Don&#8217;t know about ostrichers!&#8221; echoed Luis,
loyally, and was rewarded by a friendly slap from his
pattern and playmate.</p>

<p>Roused by the disturbance of his sheep, Pedro hurried
to quiet them, but, as he passed, fixed a piercing
gaze upon the stranger&#8217;s face. The scrutiny seemed
to partially reassure him, for he observed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Horse lame, Zulu gone, catch burro, yes. Let
the feet which take the trail be young, not feeble and
unused. But to him who journeys with evil in his
heart evil will surely come. The widow and the orphan
belong to God. Indeed, yet. &#8217;Ware, Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale reflected swiftly. He smiled at thought of
his own long legs bestriding the low back of the
donkey, but a memory of that heated trail down which
he must pass to reach the nearest house, decided the
matter. While the small owners of the burro were
improving the time of the shepherd&#8217;s absence to ransack
his dwelling the sturdy little animal bore its accustomed
rider out of sight.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jessica&#8217;s moccasined feet were flying
down the slope, her blue skirts and scarlet Tam making
a moving spot of color against the sandy glare of the
canyon wall, and long before she came within hailing
distance catching the eyes of one who eagerly awaited
her approach.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>This was John Benton, the carpenter and general
utility man at Sobrante; who had come up the opposite
side of the canyon, where were many huge bowlders, a
few trees, and no trail at all. Indeed, a passage along
that face of the gulch was difficult in extreme, and so
dangerous that it must have been serious business
which brought a lame man thither. Fortunately for his
patience, the girl paused for breath at a point level with
his own narrow perch upon a shelving rock, and where
there was no great width of the V-shaped chasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Jess! Oh! I say! Miss Jessica! Lady
Jess!&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl looked about her, up and down, everywhere
save to the further side where nobody ever went if it
could be avoided. But she answered, cheerily:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Hola!</i> Coo&#8217;ee! Coo&#8217;ee! Who are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man made a trumpet of his hands and shouted
back:</p>

<p>&#8220;The flume! Look east&#8211;to the flume!&#8221;</p>

<p>She followed his example and called through her
own fingers:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? How came you there?&#8221;</p>

<p>He pointed downward, and she shaded her eyes
from the blinding sunshine to see why, but could discover
nothing new in the familiar scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;The water! That&#8217;s where it goes! The flume is
cut!&#8221;</p>

<p>Even at that pitch, his tones were full of excited indignation,
and her own anger leaped at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody&#8217;s cut the flume? Who dared! Wait&#8211;wait&#8211;I&#8217;m
coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! Don&#8217;t. You can&#8217;t help it&#8211;you&#8217;ll break
your neck! Oh! Lady Jess!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming! Wait for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>The carpenter laughed. &#8220;Might have known she
would, and wanted she should, I suppose. Surest-footed
little thing in the world. Guess I needn&#8217;t fret.
Though when I think what this old ranch would be
without her, I don&#8217;t feel any great call to send her into
danger, myself. My! she&#8217;s as nimble as a squirrel!
Down to the bottom a&#8217;ready. Up this side in a jiffy,
and won&#8217;t her blue eyes snap when she sees this lowdown
trick? If I knew whose job it was, well, I&#8217;m a
peaceable man if I&#8217;m let, but there wouldn&#8217;t be room
enough in this here valley for the two of us. And it&#8217;s
all on a piece with the rest. One thing after another.
There&#8217;s a snake in this wigwam, but which &#8217;tis?
H-m-m! Beats me. Beats me clear to Jericho.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he fell to watching the slower, steady ascent of
Jessica, who had descended the further side so swiftly,
and who had clambered lightly enough over the roughness
of the gulch bottom; at times filled with a roaring
torrent, but now quite dry after a long, hot summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here I am!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And a sorry sight to show you. Look a&#8217; that now.
Isn&#8217;t that a regular coyote piece of work?&#8221;</p>

<p>Along this face of the canyon descended a line of
small wooden troughs, closely joined, and supported
upon slender but strong cedar uprights. This flume
connected with the distant reservoir of an irrigating
company and had been built by Jessica&#8217;s dead father
at a great and ill-afforded expense. But of all good
things there was nothing so precious to the tillers of
that thirsty land as water, and the cutting off of this
supply meant ruin to Sobrante.</p>

<p>Young as she was, Jessica fully understood this,
though she could not understand that any human being
should do a deed so dastardly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>&#8220;John Benton, you mustn&#8217;t say that. Some of the
cattle have done it. It&#8217;s an accident. It can be mended.
I&#8217;m sorry, of course, but so thankful you found it. And
I see you&#8217;ve got your tools.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I can mend it, all right, but it won&#8217;t stay
mended. You&#8217;ll see. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t the first break I&#8217;ve
patched, not by any means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it isn&#8217;t. Only last week in that stampede,
when the boys were changing pasture, the creatures ran
against it and you fixed it, good as new. There isn&#8217;t
anything you can&#8217;t do with an ax and a few nails.&#8221;</p>

<p>John passed the compliment by unheeding.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s breaks and there&#8217;s cuts. Reckon I can tell
the difference quick enough. This is a cut and isn&#8217;t the
first one I&#8217;ve found, I say. &#8217;Twas a fresh-ground
blade did this piece of deviltry, or I&#8217;m no judge of
edges. Now, who did it? Why? And how&#8217;s old
Pedro?&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite her faith in her friends, the small ranchwoman&#8217;s
heart sank.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8211;he&#8211;why, he isn&#8217;t sick at all! I was sent up
there on a fool&#8217;s errand, and just on plucking-day, when
I was so needed at home. With Wun Lung hurt and
mother so busy, I ought to have a dozen pairs of hands.
Of course, I&#8217;m glad he&#8217;s well, dear old fellow, but I
shouldn&#8217;t have gone this morning if somebody hadn&#8217;t
told Antonio wrong. I met a stranger on the trail, too,
and Zulu scared his horse, and it stumbled in a gopher
hole or something and is lamed for ever so long. He&#8217;ll
likely come to Sobrante, if he can get there, but he
looked ill if Pedro didn&#8217;t, and the sun nearly overcame
him. Can&#8217;t I help you hold that board?&#8221;</p>

<p>John accepted her offer of help less because he
needed it than because he always liked to have her near
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>&#8220;So &#8217;twas Antonio sent you, eh? H-m-m!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t send me. Course not. He just said somebody
said Pedro was dying.&#8221;</p>

<p>The carpenter laughed, but his mirth was not pleasant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Queer how stories get mixed, even in this lonesome
place. There; you needn&#8217;t hold that. Your little
hands aren&#8217;t so very strong, helpful as they may be.
This isn&#8217;t any great of a job; it &#8217;twould only stay, once
&#8217;twas finished!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go. Maybe I&#8217;d better send up one of the
boys to help you. Shall I? Who do you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon the point of declining, the carpenter changed
his mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you may. I wish you would. Send Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Send&#8211;Antonio! Why, I should as soon think of
&#8216;sending&#8217; that stranger I told you about. You&#8217;re teasing
me, for you know well that Antonio is the only one
who ever &#8216;sends&#8217; Antonio. Even my mother, who has
a right to &#8216;send&#8217; everybody on the ranch whither she
will, never orders the manager. Well, good-by. You
shall have a nice dinner out of the house-kitchen to pay
for your hard climb.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care where you step in your hurry, and just
try that word on the &#8216;senor.&#8217; Tell him there&#8217;s a bit
of a break in the flume I&#8217;d like his advice about.&#8221;</p>

<p>The workman&#8217;s laugh followed the girl down the
rough and perilous way, and just as she passed out of
hearing came the parting shot:</p>

<p>&#8220;Send Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H-m-m! I don&#8217;t see what it all means. First is
old Pedro, with his grim &#8216;'Ware Antonio!&#8217; And now
John Benton speaks in that queer way, as if there were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
two meanings to his words. Heigho! I hear somebody
coming up. I wonder who!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hurrying downward as fast as the uneven path allowed,
her own softly-shod feet making no noise, she
reached a turn of the road and suddenly slackened her
pace. The man approaching was one of the few whom
she feared and disliked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ferd, the dwarf!&#8221;</p>

<p>Instinctively, she hid behind a clump of shrubbery
and waited for him to pass, hoping he would not see
her. He did not. He was too engrossed in handling,
apparently counting, something within a deep basket
that hung on his arm, and his bare feet loped around
over the rocks as easily as they would have carried
him across the level mesa.</p>

<p>As soon as he had gone by Lady Jess started onward,
but she had grown even more thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s queer. Antonio must need Ferd to-day if
ever he does. Indeed, nobody seems able to serve him
as well as that poor half-wit. What could he have had
in his basket? And&#8211;ha! how came <i>this</i> here?&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cry of surprise she lifted a small, soft object
from the ground before her and regarded it in gathering
dismay.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>SENOR TOP-LOFTY</span></h2>

<p>Ever since Jessica could remember, Antonio Bernal
had been manager of the Sobrante ranch, and after
the death of her father, a few months before, he became
practically its master. Even Mrs. Trent deferred
to his opinions more and more, and seemed to stand
in awe of him, as did most others on the great estate.
He was the only person there, save his own servant,
Ferd, who did not treat the little girl with that adoring
sort of reverence which had given her the love-name of
&#8220;our Lady Jess.&#8221; For some reason unknown to her he
disliked her and showed this, so that she shrank from
and feared him in return.</p>

<p>As she emerged from the canyon upon the broad,
sandy road which crossed the valley, she saw him loping
toward her on the powerful black horse with which
he made his daily rounds to inspect the many industries
that Mr. Trent had established. Jessica could always
tell by the way he rode what Antonio&#8217;s mood might be,
and it did not lessen her dread to see that his sombrero
was well over his eyes and his shoulders hunched forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Something&#8217;s put him out, but I can&#8217;t help that. I
must stop him and speak to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she placed herself in the middle of the road and
shouted her familiar:</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Hola!</i> Coo-ee! Coo-ee!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>Any other ranchman would have paused and saluted
his &#8220;lady,&#8221; but the &#8220;senor&#8221; made as if he would ride
her down, unseeing.</p>

<p>Jessica did not flinch. That ready temper which she
was always lamenting flamed at the insult, and she
would not move a hair&#8217;s breadth from his path.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hola! Antonio Bernal! I must speak to you,
and&#8211;see that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly bending forward she waved something
long and black under Nero&#8217;s nose, who reared and settled
on his haunches in a way to test a less experienced
rider.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, child<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; began that irate
gentleman, but pausing at sight of the object she held.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think this a plume from Beppo&#8217;s wing, don&#8217;t you,
Antonio?&#8221;</p>

<p>He muttered something under his breath, and she
went on, explaining:</p>

<p>&#8220;I found it in the canyon, just after Ferd has gone
up it. I knew it in a minute, for I was looking Beppo
over yesterday, and I never saw such perfect feathers
on any bird. How do you suppose it came there, and
why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The fool! One of the very best. How dared he.
But suppose I&#8217;ll have to admit he stole it. I don&#8217;t see
how, though, for I did the work myself. Give it to
me, senorita; I&#8217;ll put it with the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow, when Antonio was sauve &#8220;our Lady Jess&#8221;
liked him less than when he was sharp of speech. His
native &#8220;senorita&#8221; jarred on her ear, though she blamed
herself for her injustice, nor did she yield him the
feather.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, please. I&#8217;m going to show it to mother.
She&#8217;ll be so delighted to know the plucking was a rich
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
one; and if Ferd did steal this, or has others in his
basket, of course you&#8217;ll make him bring them back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; answered Antonio, though he frowned
and searched her face with his black eyes as if to read
all her suspicions.</p>

<p>But as Jessica was not suspicious; she was vaguely
troubled, as if she had come into some dark and unknown
world. Surely Antonio was able to clear off all
these little mysteries, and she checked him again as he
was about to ride on.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something else, senor,&#8221; adopting his title in
imitation of his addressing her; &#8220;John Benton is up the
gulch fixing a break in the flume. It&#8217;s a bad one, and
more a cut than a break, he says. He asked me to tell
you and wishes you&#8217;d go up there to advise him. I&#8217;m
to send up a man to help him. But he wants you, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I waste my time on such a fool&#8217;s errand,
eh? I knew there was a leak somewhere and am
glad he&#8217;s found it. There&#8217;s been no water in the ditches
these three days&#8211;more, ten, maybe&#8211;and the oranges
are falling. Send up that idler, Joe; and, by the way,
how&#8217;s Pedro?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was the blue eyes now which turned keen and
searching, and under their gaze Antonio&#8217;s were averted
toward some distant point in the landscape, though the
contemptuous smile remained upon his lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a fool&#8217;s errand, too, Senor Bernal, and I
did so want to be at home this morning. Pedro was
never livelier. Whoever told you he was ill was quite
mistaken.&#8221;</p>

<p>Antonio gave a short, derisive laugh, dug his spurs
into Nero&#8217;s sides and loped away. A picturesque, noticeable
figure in his quaint, half-Spanish dress and his
silver-decorated sombrero, bestriding the heavy Mexican
saddle upon his powerful horse.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>&#8220;Vain as a peacock,&#8221; was his fellow-ranchmen&#8217;s
opinion of their &#8220;boss,&#8221; though had his affectations
been all his shortcomings these had not lessened their
liking for him.</p>

<p>Lady Jess looked after him for a moment, her face
still sober and perplexed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to be at home, helping mother, this minute;
but I&#8217;m going first to the corral to speak a word of
comfort to poor Beppo, and see how big a plucking
there was. If it was a good yield that will be so much
the better news to tell my dear, and this certainly is
the finest plume we ever got. Good! There are some
of the boys over there, too, and I&#8217;ll save time by getting
one of them to go up the canyon to John. <i>Hola!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Her soliloquy ended in the gay little Spanish salute,
and this was now instantly answered by a hearty shout
of welcome from a group of rough-garbed men, taking
a moment&#8217;s rest in the shade of the old adobe packinghouse.</p>

<p>As lightly as if she had not already walked a long
distance, the girl ran to her friends, to be at once
caught up by a pair of strong arms and gently placed
upon a cushion in the box of an empty wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;But this was your place, Joe Dean. I saw you get
up from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s yours now, Lady Jess. You do me proud.
What&#8217;s the good word? How&#8217;s old Pedro?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well just plain, every day well. Never been sick a
minute. Had all that climb for nothing; or, maybe,
not quite for nothing, because I met a stranger up
there and liked him; and saw John Benton as I came
down, and&#8211;found this! Isn&#8217;t that a plume to be proud
of? Raised right here on our little Sobrante.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! It&#8217;s a beauty, sure enough. A dozen like
that would be worth a tidy sum. How found it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>&#8220;Has anybody seen King Zu? Though, of course, I
know it can&#8217;t be his. He was plucked such a little
while ago, nor could he have gotten across the gulch
without losing more. Besides, Antonio said &#8216;stole.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she gave a hasty account of her morning&#8217;s adventures,
during which meaning glances were exchanged
between the trio of workmen who, by the time
she had finished, had grown as glum as they had before
been cheerful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, what do you think? Is there anybody who&#8217;d
be mean enough to cut off my mother&#8217;s irrigation, on
purpose, or steal her feathers? Even poor Ferd; I&#8217;m
sure she&#8217;s always been good to him and pitied him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ferd has hands. Others have heads,&#8221; said Joe, as
spokesman for the rest.</p>

<p>They nodded swift assent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Except yourself, Lady Jess, nobody ever sees the
&#8216;senor&#8217; handle the feathers, and you not often. Only
he and his shadow, foolish Ferd, can manage the birds,
he claims. I&#8217;ve been smoking that in my pipe along
back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Joe, you shouldn&#8217;t be suspicious of evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I shouldn&#8217;t be anything you don&#8217;t want me to
be, but I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even if I don&#8217;t like him very well, because he&#8217;s a
little cross, Antonio Bernal is a good man. He must
be. Else my father and now mother wouldn&#8217;t trust him
so. She lets him get all the money for everything first
and she has what&#8217;s left&#8211;after you&#8217;re all paid, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not poor, exactly, Samson. And it isn&#8217;t Antonio&#8217;s
fault that there isn&#8217;t so much as there used to be when
father was here. If there were, mother would carry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span>
out all father&#8217;s plans. She&#8217;d irrigate that tract beyond
the arroyo, toward the sand hills, and test it with
strawberries, as he meant. There shouldn&#8217;t be an inch
of untilled land on all the ranch, if the crops we have
paid out just a little better. But, no matter. As long
as you boys get your due wages, we can wait for the
rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was another exchange of glances which Jessica
did not see. Neither did she see herder Samson,
lying at length on the ground, lift his great boot and
significantly point to a hole in its toe. Nor would she
have surmised his meaning had she done so. Indeed,
she suddenly remembered her errand at the packinghouse
and ran to its open door, but failed.</p>

<p>&#8220;How queer! Why should this be locked? I didn&#8217;t
know it ever was. Where can the key be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Antonio Bernal&#8217;s pocket,&#8221; said Joe quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then even before I found this feather he must have
suspected somebody and taken care of the others. But
it&#8217;s dreadful if we have come to turning keys on one
another, here, at dear Sobrante. Well, I&#8217;m off to
mother, now; and, Joe, Antonio said you should go to
help John. Will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For you, fast enough, Lady Jess, though I&#8217;m about
quit of Top-Lofty&#8217;s orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Grumbler!&#8221; laughed the girl, hurrying away, with
her gayety quite restored by this few minutes&#8217; chat
with the beloved &#8220;boys&#8221; who had petted her all her life.</p>

<p>They did not laugh, however, as they watched her
going, and Joe, rising to do her bidding, slapped his
thigh emphatically and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;I call it the time has come. The longer we put it off
the worse it is. Poor little missy! Getting our wages
due! That little angel &#8217;d cry the blue out of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
pretty eyes if she knew how long &#8217;twas since we&#8217;d seen
the color of our money. Pass the word along, boys,
and let&#8217;s confab, to-night, and settle it. Time, about
moon-up, in John&#8217;s shop. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count me a mutineer,&#8221; said the ex-sailor, Samson,
as he strolled toward his cattle sheds.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you,&#8221; echoed Marty, departing for his
orange grove. &#8220;Mutiny&#8217;s an ugly word aboard ship,
I&#8217;m told, but when psalm-singing Samson takes to using
it right here on dry land I reckon the case differs. Anyhow,
if it&#8217;s a bid &#8217;twixt the little one and Top-Lofty,
I&#8217;m for the little one every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Scruff knew the road home as well as another, and
doubtless reasoned in his burro mind that the sooner
he reached there the sooner he would be rid of his
awkward rider. So he made all speed over the steep
descent, though Mr. Hale used his own feet, now and
then, as human brakes to check the creature&#8217;s pace;
and, whimsically, remonstrated when the jolts became
too frequent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, you beast! Hold on! If ever I ride a donkey
again just let me know about it, will you? Keep that
front end of yours up, please. I&#8217;ve a notion of sliding
over your head, just to accommodate. Steady, there,
steady. I flatter myself I can stick if I can&#8217;t ride. And
we&#8217;re getting along. We&#8217;re getting along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, much earlier than he had hoped for, they
were on level ground and had struck out upon that road
where Jessica had met the manager, and which for some
distance followed the tree-bordered arroyo&#8211;just then
a river of sand only&#8211;leading straight toward a group
of buildings and an oasis of greenery most welcome to
the stranger&#8217;s sun-blinded eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>&#8220;Sobrante ranch, that must be, and the home of my
little ostrich rider. I hope she&#8217;ll be there to greet me,
for a tempting spot it looks.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nearer he approached the more charming it appeared,
with its one modern, vine-covered cottage, and
its long stretches of low adobe structures&#8211;enough to
form a village in themselves&#8211;and as dingily ancient
as the other was freshly modern.</p>

<p>In reality, these old adobes were remnants of a long-abandoned
mission, but still in such excellent repair
that they were utilized for the ranchman&#8217;s quarters and
for the business of the great estate. Antonio Bernal
was the only one of all the employees who had his own
rooms at &#8220;the house,&#8221; as the cottage was called where
the Trents themselves lived.</p>

<p>From the kitchen of this attractive &#8220;house&#8221; now
floated a delectable odor of well-cooked food, and with
the reflection that he was always hungry nowadays, the
visitor crossed to its open window; there came, also, a
girlish voice, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother, I&#8217;m sure he was a gentleman, though
he didn&#8217;t look well. I told him you weren&#8217;t fond of
strangers and had little time to give them, but that I
thought you&#8217;d make him welcome. Indeed, there&#8217;s nowhere
else for him to go, since his horse is lame and
we so far from everybody. He lost his trail, he said.
Was I right?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then his shadow fell across the sun-lighted floor
and Jessica faced about. With a whisk of the saucepan,
in which she was scrambling eggs, she added:
&#8220;Well, right or wrong, here he is!&#8221; But she was talking
to empty air, for her mother had disappeared.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN INTERRUPTED SUPPER</span></h2>

<p>The young ranchwoman placed her pan in safety and
ran out upon that north porch, where the table was
already spread, to meet the visitor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve gotten here all safe. How did
you do it? It&#8217;s a long walk for those who aren&#8217;t used
to it. Even for those who are, too. Did you ride your
horse? Was he better?&#8221;</p>

<p>She rattled off her questions without waiting for replies
and to give him time to recover his breath, which
he seemed to have lost. Then she poured him a glass
of milk and urged him to drink it, with the remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Blandina&#8217;s own. She&#8217;s the house-cow.
You&#8217;ll find it delicious. Don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine milk,&#8221; answered the other, cautiously; &#8220;but,
if it isn&#8217;t too much trouble, a bit of ice would improve
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ice? Why, where could I get ice? Sometimes, in
the winter, a little forms along the arroyo, but now&#8211;I&#8217;m
very sorry, indeed. I&#8217;d be so glad to get it if I
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale swallowed the sickeningly warm liquid with
a gulp and hastened to apologize.</p>

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be good for me if you could. My
compliments to your house-cow, and I&#8217;m very grateful
for my refreshment. You have a beautiful home.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t we? The prettiest in the world, I guess.
My father thought so and my mother loves it. So do
we all, but to her it is dearest. Because, you see, father
and she have made it all it is. Please, just let me
move your chair nearer the edge of the porch. So.
Now, look away off to the east. Father said there
could be no view more uplifting. He wished everybody
who had to live in cities could see it. He knew
it would make them better men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Magnificent though it was, Mr. Hale found his
small hostess more interesting than the view.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; he began, questioningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t here, now. He passed heavenward a year ago.
Since then nothing seems just the same, and dear
mother is often sad and troubled. You know she wants
to carry on all father&#8217;s experiments, she doesn&#8217;t want
his &#8216;life work to be wasted,&#8217; she says, and Antonio isn&#8217;t
able to get as much money as he used to be. She tries
so bravely not to let it fret her, and I don&#8217;t see where
she is. She was in the kitchen with me. We were getting
dinner because Wun Lung, the cook, cut his hand,
and Pasqual isn&#8217;t to be trusted. Of course, he&#8217;s a good
enough boy, can make beds and such things, but&#8211;cook!
One must be very dainty to do that. My
mother can cook deliciously! She taught herself everything
and the why of it. When she and father came
here they lived in that tiny adobe away at the end of
the second row. Do you see it? By the old corridor.
Their table was a packing box and they had just a little
camping outfit. Now there&#8217;s all this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica Trent&#8217;s sweet face glowed with loving pride
in her fair home, but this was as nothing of the tenderness
which filled her eyes as they now caught sight
of a tall woman in black coming over the garden path.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is, my mother!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>Mr. Hale rose as the lady drew near and one glance
showed him what model &#8220;Lady Jess&#8221; had chosen as a
type of that &#8220;perfect&#8221; breeding to which the little
maid aspired. The mistress of Sobrante was a real
gentlewoman, even though her gown was of cheapest
print and her surroundings those of an isolated western
ranch. Her daughter ran to cast a clinging, yet protecting,
arm about her, and proudly turning toward
their guest, presented:</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother, Mrs. Trent, Mr. <span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221; and smiling
waited for him to finish the sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hale. I had forgotten to mention my name before,
even though we have chatted so cosily. Permit me,
madam.&#8221;</p>

<p>The card he offered bore the inscription:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Morris Hale, Attorney at Law, 156 Broadway,
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>Watchful Jessica saw her mother&#8217;s face pale, while
into her native cordiality of manner crept that slight
hauteur with which she regarded the most objectionable
of &#8220;tourists.&#8221; This, then, was one such, and the
girl was sorry. She had liked the stranger so much
and was already planning pleasant entertainment for
him; but if her dear did not approve of him her own
opinion went for naught.</p>

<p>Yet it was only the statement of the gentleman&#8217;s
business that had caused Mrs. Trent&#8217;s momentary coldness,
for at that time, though her daughter did not
know this, the mere suggestion of law or lawyers disturbed
her. But she was quick to feel the possible injustice
of her fear and to atone for it by a deeper
cordiality.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have come just in time to share our dinner,
Mr. Hale, and we&#8217;ll not wait any longer for laggards.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
I was looking for the children. Jessie, dear, have you
seen them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not since breakfast, mother. But they can&#8217;t be far
away, for there&#8217;s Scruff yonder, trying to get into the
alfalfa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Antonio hasn&#8217;t come up, either, since the plucking.
I wish he would while the food is fresh. If you&#8217;ll<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We needn&#8217;t wait for him, because I met him riding
toward the foothills, as I came home. He&#8217;s probably
off to the mines and that means an all-day&#8217;s trip. But
I&#8217;ll help you dish up, and seek the boys, though they
don&#8217;t often need seeking at mealtime. You sit right
down with Mr. Hale, dear, and I&#8217;ll serve you. Pasqual
can bring in the tureen, and I hope the eggs aren&#8217;t
spoiled by waiting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Scruff that mottled burro poking his nose
through that fence?&#8221; asked the guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He belongs to my little son, Ned, who shares
him with his playmate, Luis. An inseparable trio,
usually.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m the cause of their present separation. I
rode that animal down from old Pedro&#8217;s cabin and at
his advice,&#8221; Mr. Hale described his meeting with the
two small lads, the fright they had given him, and his
own desertion of them. &#8220;Though now I&#8217;m ashamed
to recall how readily I consigned them to a tramp I
was unwilling to take myself. I wish I&#8217;d brought
them with me. We could have used Scruff&#8217;s back,
turn and turn about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh how could they! One misstep and they&#8217;d have
been killed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, mother?&#8221; asked Jessica, seeing the lady&#8217;s
hand shake so that she could scarcely serve the soup
which formed the chief dish of their plain dinner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>&#8220;Only another prank of those terrifying children.
Bound themselves&#8211;or had help to bind&#8211;and rode
Scruff bareback up the canyon! They&#8217;re always &#8216;playing
Indian,&#8217; and I wish they&#8217;d never heard of one. It&#8217;s
that Ferd eggs them on. He &#8216;dares&#8217; them and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>Excuse
me, Mr. Hale. Mothers are anxious people. Try
some of Jessie&#8217;s scramble, please. She is just learning
to cook and likes to be appreciated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t see them, as I went up or down. They
must have taken the long road around by the north
end. Where the old Digger village is,&#8221; observed Jessie.</p>

<p>&#8220;A forbidden route. It&#8217;s to be hoped they&#8217;ll follow
the shortest road home. If they&#8217;re not here in an hour
one of the men must go to fetch them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica laughed and kissed her mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry, dear, and do, please, eat your dinner.
Aren&#8217;t those children always having hairbreadth
escapes, and are they ever hurt? Pedro&#8217;ll send them
down in a hurry. He knows his mistress and her ways,
and wouldn&#8217;t let her be troubled if he could help it.
They&#8217;ll get no dinner at Pedro&#8217;s, and dinner is something
they&#8217;ve never missed yet. Hark! Aren&#8217;t going
to miss now! Listen. They&#8217;re fighting along home in
their regular fashion. By the sound they&#8217;ve about got
to prickly-pear hedge. <i>Hola!</i> Ned! Lu-is! Oh! beg
pardon. I forgot I was at table. Excuse me, mother,
and I&#8217;ll bring in the youngsters&#8211;after a deluge!&#8221;</p>

<p>Already there was an uproar in the outer kitchen,
where two tired and hungry little boys were assaulting
the unoffending Pasqual, diligently scrubbing away
at his pots and pans. Any victim will do, at a pinch,
to vent one&#8217;s wrath upon, and Pasqual was nearest.
But he was not one to suffer patiently, and promptly returned
the puny blows of his assailants with much
more vigorous ones, till Jessica reached the spot, rescued
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
the truants, and conducted them to the washbasin.</p>

<p>From there, disdaining the towel, they made rapid
transit to the porch and the presence of the stranger.
All along their enforced walk home they had laid plans
of vengeance, among which &#8220;tommyhawking&#8221; and
&#8220;shootin&#8217; chock full o&#8217; arrers&#8221; were the wildest. But,
alas! Now that their enemy was in their very power,
they had no fiercer weapons than four grimy little
fists. Better these than nothing, was Ned&#8217;s instant
decision, and Luis was but Ned&#8217;s second thought. As
Ned&#8217;s right descended upon Mr. Hale&#8217;s shoulders, Luis&#8217;
left delivered a telling blow upon the gentleman&#8217;s hand,
uplifted toward his lips. This was small assistance to
the yellow-haired chief, for the spoon fled straight
from the victim&#8217;s fingers and landed squarely in Ned&#8217;s
face.</p>

<p>This created intense diversion. The blows intended
for the guest were now bestowed upon each other, and
so impartially that neither side was worsted. Mrs.
Trent rose in her place, flushed and apologetic, though
the stranger was far more surprised than offended,
while the sister had once more appeared and terminated
a battle almost before it was begun. With a strength
of which she did not look capable she caught up and
lifted a child into each of the two high chairs in waiting&#8211;but
wisely placed at opposite sides of the board.
There they settled themselves composedly, beaming
and smiling upon each other like a pair of wingless
cherubs, while Ned thrust forth a tin basin and demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me my soup, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gimmesoup!&#8221; echoed Luis, choking over a piece of
bread he had filched from Jessica&#8217;s plate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>&#8220;Oh! Huh! Please give me my soup, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plea&#8217; gimmesoup, <i>madr&#8217;</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t your <i>madre</i>, Luis Garcia. Isn&#8217;t nobody&#8217;s
mother but mine, so there!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; remarked Jessica. &#8220;What about me?&#8221;</p>

<p>This set Ned off into a giggle, in which Luis dutifully
joined, and the laughter restored the best of feelings
all around. The meal over, Mrs. Trent offered
the guest the use of a room in which to rest, and this
he gladly accepted; adding that he wished he might
be able to make some arrangement with her by which
he could occupy it indefinitely, till his health was restored
and the business which had brought him to that
region was completed. Any terms she would make
would be most satisfactory to him, for he was charmed
with Sobrante and most anxious to sojourn there for
a time.</p>

<p>Jessica was already clearing the table, yet watching
her mother closely, and was surprised to see a moment&#8217;s
hesitation on the dear face before the expected
and customary answer came:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are always glad to make our friends welcome at
Sobrante, and for as long as our simple life suits
them, but we could not accept payment for our hospitality.
I am glad you like our home, and Jessica will
show you to the friend&#8217;s room at once. Tell Pasqual,
my dear, to attend Mr. Hale and see that he has all
which he requires. All that may be supplied at this
isolated spot, that is,&#8221; she added, with a smile.</p>

<p>Mr. Hale thanked his hostess and withdrew, but he
felt that he had practically been dismissed from the
ranch and that he had no past friendship to urge as a
plea for any but the briefest visit there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>Yet the cool chamber into which the traveler was
shown proved so restful that the &#8220;forty winks only&#8221;
which he intended were prolonged till sunset. Then he
hastily descended to the lower floor to find that the
early supper of the household was over; though Mrs.
Trent had kept his own portion hot, and smilingly
waved aside his apologies as she placed before him a
dish of delicately broiled quail, prepared by her own
skillful hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, this is a luxury! and to be expected only at
some great hotel. By the way, where is the nearest
one? I should have been on my way long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not. And you cannot well reach any hotel
to-night. The nearest is thirty miles away, and for a
long distance the road is a mere track across the plain.
Even those who are used to it, would find it difficult to
keep it on a moonless night, as this will be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m so sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>The hostess&#8217; face grew anxious. &#8220;Is it so important?
I thought<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! That&#8217;s another of my blunders. My regret
is that I must force myself upon your hospitality
after<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent interrupted with a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I imagine we&#8217;re talking at cross-purposes. While I
cannot make any guest comfortable at Sobrante &#8216;indefinitely,&#8217;
as you proposed, I should be disappointed
to have you leave us hurriedly, I&#8217;d like you to inspect
the ranch, thoroughly, and that will require at least a
week. Besides, since I&#8217;ve learned from your card that
you are a lawyer, I would like to ask your advice. Of
course, if you are willing to give it in a business way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be happy to serve you and more than happy
to stay for the week you propose, I came<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>But he did not finish his sentence. There rang
through the quiet room the echoes of rifle shots, repeated
singly and in volleys, and accompanied by shouts
and shrieks, so fierce and unearthly that Mr. Hale
sprang to his feet while his hand sought his own pistol
pocket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horrible! In the midst of this peace&#8211;an Indian
outbreak!&#8221;</p>

<p>A curious thrill ran through his veins, as if his sixty
years had suddenly turned backward to sixteen, and,
with an answering cry, he leaped through the open
window and rushed straight into the arms of a man
who had already reached the porch and was making for
the very room that the stranger had just quitted.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>COUNTER REVOLT</span></h2>

<p>The collision staggered both men and gave Mrs.
Trent time to reach the side of her guest and to lay a
restraining hand upon his arm. Her voice was tremulous
with laughter as she explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only a rifle practice. The ranchmen and the
children&#8211;all children in this sport&#8211;and always noisy.
I&#8217;m sorry it disturbed you, but&#8211;Indians! How could
you imagine it. Ah! Antonio, good-evening. Have
you had supper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, senora. I need it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is waiting. This visitor, Mr. Hale, Senor Antonio
Bernal, the manager of Sobrante.&#8221;</p>

<p>The gentlemen bowed, one with the brevity of a busy
man, the other with the profound salutation of his race.
But they parted immediately, for the Easterner was
anxious to witness the shooting and the superintendent
to break his long fast; and with disgust at his own
readiness to fancy danger where none existed, Mr.
Hale followed the sound of the yells and cheers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hi! hi! for the little one! Hit him again, blue
jacket!&#8221; shrieked Samson, as, steadying upon a tie-post
the rifle he was too small to support, Ned sighted
the bull&#8217;s-eye of a distant target, took a careless aim,
yet struck it squarely.</p>

<p>Whereupon the strong ex-sailor thrust the weapon
aside and tossed the lad in the air as if he had been a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
ball. Yet caught him as he lightly descended, and
placed him astride his own shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;ll beat the little master? Three times out o&#8217;
seven, with an iron heavy as that, how&#8217;s the showing
for an eight-year-old?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ned slipped from the ranchman&#8217;s back, picked
up his own tiny, perfectly finished gun, and swung it
over his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! That&#8217;s nothing! Huh! This the feller!
Huh! Guess &#8217;tis. Shot more&#8217;n forty-&#8217;leven quails this
day &#8217;t ever was. Had &#8217;em for my supper. Had &#8217;em
for the man broke his horse&#8217;s leg and stole Scruff.
Hello, Mister! Had your supper? Wasn&#8217;t them good
birds? I shot &#8217;em for you. I did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You?&#8221; demanded the gentleman, astonished. He
had now joined the group surrounding the three children,
and his presence caused a lull in the uproar
which had preceded his arrival. &#8220;You! Why you
aren&#8217;t big enough to do such a thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did! I did! I never told a lie in all my life&#8211;never,
never, never! So, there!&#8221; and unable to endure
such an imputation, the child rushed upon his traducer
and pounded him well with the butt of his little rifle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ned! Edward Trent! Stop! You&#8211;a little gentleman&#8211;mother&#8217;s
son!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s arms were about her brother, restraining
his movements and for a moment making him drop his
head in shame. The next he had broken from her
grasp, caught up another gun and dragged it toward
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your turn, Jess. Hurry up. There&#8217;s just an inch
of sun left&#8211;I mean there was a minute ago&#8211;hurry
up! Me an&#8217; Luis&#8217;s got to go to bed quick as a wink!
Hurry&#8211;hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; echoed Luis, with a yawn, and dropping
down where he stood, was instantly asleep.</p>

<p>John Benton crossed to the visitor&#8217;s side and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I tell you, stranger, you&#8217;ll see the sight of
your life. If I was a betting man I&#8217;d back Our Lady
Jess again&#8217; any other girl-shooter on the globe. You
just watch out&#8211;if the dark holds off a spell.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were a dozen, maybe, of the ranchmen standing
or lying around in a semi-circle, but now all quiet
and intent upon the little girl, as, nodding and smiling
upon her guest and her beloved &#8220;boys,&#8221; she stepped
into the open space before them all. &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221;
March, unerring marksman and the children&#8217;s instructor,
took his place beside her, examined her rifle,
handed it to her and also observed to the stranger:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if nothin&#8217; happens, you&#8217;ll see sunthin&#8217;. Sorry
it&#8217;s so dusk, but any gent what doubt&#8217;s is free to walk up
to the target and look where the ball strikes. You,
lady, do me proud.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; said Jessica, simply. &#8220;Is it the little nail
in the center?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighted and fired; and a ranchman who had run
forward to the target, shouted back across the darkening
space:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hit her plumb!&#8221;</p>

<p>A roar of applause greeted this announcement, but
the girl accepted this tribute with no comment save
another nod and smile, as she waited her teacher&#8217;s
next direction.</p>

<p>This was given silently by a gesture downward.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>Instantly Jessica dropped upon the ground, rested
herself upon her elbows, aimed, fired, and&#8211;&#8220;Hit
her again! Hooray for Our Lady! Hooray&#8211;hooray&#8211;hooray!&#8221;</p>

<p>In his excitement big Samson seized Mr. Hale by
the sleeve and compelled that gentleman to jog-trot
across the open and view at closer range the wonderful
skill of the little maid who was so dear to them all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand aside, Psalm Singer. Your head&#8217;s in the
way!&#8221; cautioned somebody.</p>

<p>Still clutching his companion, Samson obeyed, and
they saw Jessica now lying upon her back, sighting
upward and backward over her head a small, white object
that had been placed in the target where the tack
had been. There was no cheering then, nor any movement
among the eager watchers who fairly held their
breaths lest they disturb their darling in that supreme
moment of her success or failure.</p>

<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;ll not fail!&#8221; thought more than one, and
would have given a year&#8217;s wages that she should not.</p>

<p>There was a swift rush of something through the
air, so close to Mr. Hale&#8217;s nose that he visibly drew
back, and a double report as the bullet hit the toy torpedo
which had been the chosen mark.</p>

<p>After that, pandemonium; or so it seemed to Mr.
Hale. Those gray and grizzled men&#8211;for there were
few young among them&#8211;shouted themselves hoarse
and gave way to the wildest expressions of pride and
delight. As for Jessica, the heroine, though her eyes
sparkled and a flush rose to her cheeks, she was by far
the calmest person present. Even Mr. Hale&#8217;s heart
was beating rapidly and he caught the girl&#8217;s hands and
shook them violently, in his congratulations.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>&#8220;That was marvelous! marvelous! I&#8217;ve seen pretty
good sharp-shooting done by professionals, but never
anything so fine as that last shot of yours. How
could you ever learn it, so young as you are?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I help learning? It is &#8216;Forty-niner's&#8217;
work, a deal more than mine. He&#8217;s been teaching me
ever since I could hold a tiny bow and arrow. He&#8217;s
wonderful, if you please; but I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>Well, it seems just
to do itself, somehow. But I must go in now. Time
for the little ones to be in bed. Come, Ned. Come,
Luis. Oh, dear! he&#8217;s fast asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pack him for you, lady. And say, boys, isn&#8217;t
this the time?&#8221;</p>

<p>Samson had lifted the sleeping Luis, tucked him
under one arm and swung Ned to the other, but now
paused to glance around among his fellow-workmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time was &#8216;moon-up,&#8217;&#8221; answered Joe, minded to be
facetious.</p>

<p>&#8220;This would be &#8216;moon-up,&#8217; if the old girl knew her
business,&#8221; retorted the sailor. &#8220;In ten minutes we&#8217;ll
be with you. Come, on, my lady. I&#8217;ve a word to say
to you and the mistress.&#8221;</p>

<p>The daily evening sport was over and the ranchmen
rapidly dispersed, each to his own quarters, and none
considering it his especial business to entertain the
stranger, who was now strolling slowly houseward
mindful of the sudden chill which came with the nightfall
and of his own unfitness for exposure.</p>

<p>Proudest of all, &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; gathered up the weapons
and carried them off, to clean and put in order for
the next evening&#8217;s practice. He was well satisfied with
his pupil&#8217;s achievements, though already planning more
difficult feats for their performance. The man was
eighty; yet, while his abundant hair was white, his
back was still straight and his step firm. The joy of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span>
his old age was the athletic training of the Sobrante
children, and it would have amazed him, even broken
his heart, had he been told that by such means he did
not well earn his keep. He was eldest of all the elderly
workmen that the late master of the ranch had gathered
about him, and his appreciation of this good home
in which to end his days perhaps, the greatest of all.
It was, therefore, a terrible shock which awaited him,
as entering his own room, he lighted his lamp and saw
lying on his table a white envelope addressed to himself.</p>

<p>He knew what it meant. Dismissal.</p>

<p>One year before, when Cassius Trent died, there had
been twenty employees where there were now but thirteen&#8211;he
the &#8220;odd one&#8221; of the &#8220;baker&#8217;s dozen.&#8221; Seven
times, when least expected or desired, some one of
these twenty had found in his room just such an envelope,
containing his arrears of wages, and the curt
information that, &#8220;by the order of Mrs. Trent, his
services were no longer required at Sobrante, nor
would any wages be forthcoming from that day forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>These men had all been friends, rather than servants,
and in each case the result had been the same.
Cut to the heart by the manner of discharge, and, for
the first time it may be, realizing that he was no longer
young, and, therefore, valuable, the recipient of the
envelope had quietly disappeared, saying farewell to
nobody.</p>

<p>&#8220;My turn! My turn, at last!&#8221; broke from the aged
frontiersman&#8217;s lips, and a groan followed. &#8220;Ten years
I&#8217;ve lived in this old adobe cell till I&#8217;ve come to feel
like the monk for whom it was first built. Now<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The white head drooped forward on the outstretched
arms and all the burden of his eighty years seemed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
suddenly to have descended upon that bowed and
shrunken figure.</p>

<p>In the pretty dining-room Antonio Bernal had eaten
a hearty supper served by his own mistress, since Wun
Lung was not to be found and the house-boy, Pasqual,
claimed his usual recreation hour at the rifle practice.
But neither thought anything amiss in this, and the
manager would, indeed, have asserted that it was quite
the proper thing. Was not he a Bernal, and superior
to all at Sobrante? Even though he was, for the
time being, receiving wage instead of bestowing. Well,
it was a long lane that had no turning.</p>

<p>Pushing back from the table, Antonio had murmured
the proverb in Spanish, with a smile of satisfaction
lighting his dark face, and Mrs. Trent had failed
to hear distinctly, though she was familiar enough
with the language so often in use about her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, I did not understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Begging pardon, one&#8217;s self, senora, it is seldom that
you do. It is the business was never made for the
small brains of the women, no? &#8217;Tis the senora&#8217;s place
to be beautiful and let the business rest in the capable
hands of I, myself. <i>En verdad.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent colored and bit her lip. This man&#8217;s insolence
was becoming insupportable, and she could
scarcely recognize him for the obsequious fellow who
had been her husband&#8217;s right-hand dependence. His
brief authority had turned his head, she reflected, and,
again, that she must in no wise offend him. The welfare
of her children demanded this, and forcing herself
to smile as pleasantly as if his insult were a jest, she
remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;The gentleman whom you met, as you came in, is a
lawyer. A New York lawyer. I&#8211;I would like to consult
him about our&#8211;this business you mention. I was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
born and reared in New York and have a feeling that
anything which comes from there must be all right.
Even a lawyer, though I&#8217;m not fond of the profession
usually.</p>

<p>&#8220;The senor is not wont to waste so many words upon
her most humble servant, no. And as for the lawyers,
have I not this day been to the consulting of the most
eminent, the wisest of his kind, no? But yes; and the
truth is, senora&#8211;believe me, it breaks my heart so to
inform you, but this barren rancho of Sobrante belongs
not to the Dona Gabriella and her children, but
to one Antonio Bernal, even I, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To you! Belongs&#8211;to&#8211;you?&#8221; gasped the astonished
woman.</p>

<p>The manager shrugged his shoulders and tossed
another Spanish proverb toward her: &#8220;What I have
said, I have said.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent felt her strength leaving her and sank
into a chair, still gazing incredulously at the other, who
now lounged back in his own chair and began to leisurely
pick his teeth. It was a trivial action, but one
wholly disgusting to the gentlewoman&#8217;s fastidious
sense, and it angered her, which was a good thing, for
her anger banished her momentary faintness and gave
her boldness to demand:</p>

<p>&#8220;The proof!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be forthcoming, senora, at the right time.
Yes. Meanwhile, I am content you shall remain, you
and your little ones, until&#8211;well, say a month. By that
date all things should have been arranged and the
senora will have found herself another home less lonely
than Sobrante. One so beautiful as the Dona Gabriella
must have hosts of friends who<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Senor Bernal paused. There were footsteps approaching,
and the merry voices of children, and an instant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
later Samson was in the room, still carrying the little
lads in his arms, and with Jessica clinging affectionately
to his ragged sleeve.</p>

<p>One glance showed the faithful ranchman that something
was amiss. There was fresh sorrow, even consternation,
in the beloved face of Sobrante&#8217;s mistress,
fresh insolence in that of her chief assistant. He was
not one to hesitate when his friends were in trouble,
and turned to Antonio with an angry demand:</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been worrying your betters with
now, senor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep a civil tongue in your head, rascal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Returnin&#8217; the compliment, if you please. All the
same, don&#8217;t you know that a man&#8211;<i>a man</i>&#8211;doesn&#8217;t go
around worrying women as you worry Mrs. Trent?
You, that hadn&#8217;t a shirt to your back when the boss
took you in and made you what you are! I&#8217;m anticipatin&#8217;
a mite, and I don&#8217;t know just how some of the
boys&#8217;ll take it, but we&#8217;d laid out this very night at
moon-up&#8211;if there&#8217;d been a moon sensible enough to
get up, which there isn&#8217;t&#8211;to haul you and a few other
matters over the coals and stir up a fresh sort of blaze.
Now, I warn you, just you let matters slide, peaceable,
and you&#8211;just you, yourself, keep that civil tongue you
recommend, or you&#8217;ll light out of here so quick ye
won&#8217;t see your heels for dust, dry season though it is.
Hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hear? Yes, I hear. Now, &#8217;tis your turn. You go
tell those malcontents you call &#8216;the boys&#8217; to take their
packs and foot it. Times have changed. Things have
changed. There&#8217;s another master here now, and not a
weak-willed mistress. That is me&#8211;I&#8211;Antonio Bernal,
owner of Sobrante rancho and all that appertains
thereto. Now, go. Vamos. Depart. Clear out. Get!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>Samson went&#8211;as far as the long, open window, and
stepped out upon the porch. He did not see Mr. Hale,
who had seated himself in a rocker, an unintentional
witness of a scene he would gladly have missed, and
putting a whistle to his lips blew a summons which was
understood by every fellow-workman on the ranch.
Then he quietly re-entered the house, folded his arms,
and leaned carelessly against the door frame.</p>

<p>Senor Bernal started up as if he would forcibly eject
the herder, but thought better of this and sank back
nonchalantly in his great chair. Jessica had placed
herself behind her mother, and clasped Mrs. Trent&#8217;s
shoulders with the protecting tenderness habitual to
her. Ned had sprung to his mother&#8217;s lap and Luis continued
his nap at her feet; while all seemed waiting for
some fresh development of the affair.</p>

<p>This came and speedily; for, in answer to Samson&#8217;s
whistle, there filed over the porch and into the room,
Joe, the smith; Marty, the gardener; and Carpenter
John. There was missing old &#8220;Forty-niner,&#8221; commonly
the dominant fifth of this odd quintet, but
nobody wondered much at that. Doubtless he was
polishing his darling&#8217;s rifle and making ready for some
astonishing display of her skill wherewith to dazzle
the stranger upon the morrow. In any case he rarely
disagreed with the opinions of his cronies and was sure
to be one with them in the matter of that hour.</p>

<p>With a respectful salute to Mrs. Trent, a grin
toward the children, and a scowl for Antonio, these
stalwart ranchmen lined up against the wall and stood
at attention. Mr. Hale, observant through the doorway,
again noticed that each of these was well along in
years, that each had some slight physical infirmity, and
that, despite these facts, each looked a man of unusual
strength and most entire devotion. Indeed, the gaze
fixed upon the little lady, was one of adoration, and the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
situation boded ill for anybody who meant harm to
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem. What say, mates? Has the hour struck?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The hour has struck,&#8221; answered John Benton, solemnly,
shifting his weight from his lame leg to his
sound one.</p>

<p>Samson strode a mighty step forward and pulled his
forelock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I state, madam, that we here, on behalf of
ourselves and our whole crew, now, and hereby do,
throw off all &#8217;legiance to that there Spanish skunk,
a-settin&#8217; in your easiest chair, and appoint Our Lady
Jess, captain of the good ship Sobrante. Allowin&#8217; you
to be the admiral of that same, madam, but takin&#8217; no
more orders from anybody save and excepting her&#8211;under
you, of course&#8211;from this time forth, so help us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then there burst from the trio of throats a cheer that
shook the windows, and called a contemptuous laugh
from the superintendent so valiantly defied.</p>

<p>The cheer died in an ominous silence which Senor
Bernal improved.</p>

<p>&#8220;Highly dramatic and most edifying, <i>en verdad.</i>
Senor, I kiss your hands in even greater devotion. But
the play has one little drawback. To I, me, myself,
belongs Sobrante. Already I have had the law of which
you spoke. My claim I have proved. From the long
back generations the good title from the Mission
Padres to my own fathers, yes. Sobrante? <i>Si.</i> More
and better. Wide lies the valley of Paraiso d&#8217;Oro.
Mine, Mine. All&#8211;all mine. No?&#8221;</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and pompously paced up and
down the room, insolently handsome and proud of the
fact, while out on the darkened porch Mr. Hale had
heard a word which set his own pulses beating faster
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
and the row of ranchmen started forward as if minded
to throw the braggart out of the house.</p>

<p>But Jessica stepped forth and cried, triumphantly,
though still with an effort toward that courtesy she
desired.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, Senor Antonio Bernal, but surely you
are quite mistaken. My father taught me some things.
He said I was not too young to learn them. He&#8211;he
only&#8211;has the title deed to dear Sobrante, and I&#8211;I
only&#8211;know the safe place where it is kept!&#8221;</p>

<p>Antonio halted in his strutting march and for a moment
his face grew pale. The next instant he had
regained more than his former confidence, and with a
sneering laugh, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Seeing is believing, no? To the satisfaction of the
assembled most honorable company,&#8221; here he bowed
with mock politeness, &#8220;let this most interesting document
be produced. <i>Si.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica flew from the room and in an intolerable
anxiety the whole &#8220;honorable company&#8221; awaited her
long-delayed return.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>NIGHT VISIONS</span></h2>

<p>When the tension of waiting was becoming intolerable,
and Mrs. Trent was already rising to seek her
daughter, Jessica reappeared in the doorway. Her
white face and frightened eyes told her story without
words, but her mother forced herself to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find it, darling?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, it is gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone. Yet it was only that dear, last day when he
was with us, in the morning, before he set out for the
mines, that he showed it to me, safe and sound in its
place. He was to tell you, too, that night&#8211;but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was that, then, which was on his mind, and I
could not understand. I&#8211;Antonio Bernal, he entrusted
you and you must know; where is that missing
deed?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Deed, senora? This day, just ended, is it not that
I have been over all the records and there is none of
any deed to Sobrante later than my own&#8211;or that
proves my claim. In truth, the honorable Dona Gabriella
is right, indeed. I was the trusted friend of the
dead senor, and if any such precious document existed,
would I not have known it? <i>Si.</i> What I do know is
the worry, the trouble, the impossibility of such a paper
broke the senor&#8217;s heart. It does not exist. Sobrante
is mine. He knew that this was so&#8211;I had often
spoken<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>The untruth he was about to utter did not pass his
lips. There was that in the white face of Gabriella
Trent which arrested his words, as, clasping her boy
in her arms, she glided into the darkened hall and
entered her own rooms beyond.</p>

<p>The &#8220;boys&#8221; had not moved, nor Jessica followed, and
she now firmly confronted the manager, saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry to tell you, Antonio Bernal, that you are
not acting square. My father did have that title deed,
and I believe you know it. Somebody has taken it from
the place where his own hands put it, but I will find it.
This home is ours, is all my mother&#8217;s. Nobody shall
ever take it from her. Nobody. You hear me say that,
Senor Antonio Bernal, and you, dear &#8216;boys?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay,&#8221; echoed her friends, heartily; but the superintendent
regarded her as he might have done some
amusing little insect.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very pretty, senorita. The filial devotion, almost
beautiful. But the facts&#8211;well, am I not merciful and
generous, I? There is no haste. Indeed, no. A
month<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Before a month is out I will have found that deed
and placed it in my darling mother&#8217;s hands. I may be
too young to understand the &#8216;business&#8217; you talk about
so much, but I am not too young to save my mother&#8217;s
happiness. I can see that paper now, in my mind, and
I remember exactly how it looked inside and out. It
seemed such a little thing to be worth a whole, great
ranch. I don&#8217;t know how nor where, but somehow and
somewhere, I shall find that paper. &#8216;Boys,&#8217; will you
help me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the last drop of our hearts&#8217; blood!&#8221; cried John
Benton, and the others echoed, &#8220;Ay, ay!&#8221;</p>

<p>Antonio thought it time to end this scene and walked
toward the porch, at the further end of which was another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
long window opening into his own apartments.
But he was not permitted to leave so easily. Great
Samson placed himself in the manager&#8217;s path and
remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no call to lose sight of the main business
&#8217;count o&#8217; this little side-play of yours. We boys come
up here to-night to quit your employ and hire out to
Our Lady Jess. We&#8217;re all agreed, every man jack of
us. Your day&#8217;s over. Account of Mrs. Trent and the
kids, we&#8217;d like things done quiet and decent. There&#8217;s a
good horse of yours in the stable and though there isn&#8217;t
any moon, you know the roads well. If you tarry for
breakfast, likely you won&#8217;t have much appetite to eat
it. More&#8217;n that, the senora, as you call her, has waited
on your whelpship for just the last time. Before you
start you might as well pay up some of our back wages,
and hand over to the mistress the funds you&#8217;ve been
keeping from her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Insolent! Stand aside. How dare you? Let me
pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not quite through yet. There&#8217;s no real call to
have talk with such as you, but we &#8216;boys&#8217; kind of resent
being set down as plumb fools. We&#8217;ve seen through
you, though we&#8217;ve kept our mouths shut. Now they&#8217;re
open; leastways, mine is. This here notion of yours
about ownin&#8217; Sobrante is a bird of recent hatchin&#8217;.
&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t full-fledged yet, and &#8217;s likely never to be. Your
first idea was to run the ranch down till your mistress
had to give it up out of sheer bad luck. Fail, mortgage,
or such like. Oranges didn&#8217;t sell for what they
ought; olives wasn&#8217;t worth shucks; some little varmint
got to eating the raisin grapes; mine petered out;
feathers growing poorer every plucking, though the
birds are getting valuabler. Never had accounts quite
ready&#8211;you, that was a master hand at figures when
the boss took you in and made you, You<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>Antonio strode forward, furious, and with uplifted
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You rascal! This to me&#8211;I, Antonio Bernal, descendant
of&#8211;Master of Sobrante and Paraiso, I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Master? Humph! Owner? Fiddlesticks! Why,
that little tacker there, asleep on the floor,&#8221; pointing to
Luis, &#8220;is likelier heir to this old ranch than you. The
country&#8217;s full of Garcias and always has been, Pedro
says. Garcia himself, when all&#8217;s told. As for Bernals,
who ever heard of more&#8217;n one o&#8217; them? That&#8217;s you,
you skunk! Now, usin&#8217; your own fine, highfalutin&#8217; language:
&#8216;Go. <i>Vamos.</i> Depart. Clear out. <i>Get!</i>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I go&#8211;because it so suits me, I, myself. But I return.
New servants will be with me and your quarters
must be empty. Let me pass.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certain. Anything to oblige. But don&#8217;t count on
them quarters. We couldn&#8217;t leave them if we would
&#8217;cause we&#8217;ve all took root. Been growing so long;
become indigenous to the soil, like the boss&#8217; experiments.
Thrive so well might have been born here and
certainly mean to die on the spot. Going? Well, good-night.
Call again. <i>Adios.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Jessica was laughing, as her old friend
had meant she should be. In his contemptuous harangue
of the man he disliked and mistrusted, there had been
more humor than anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my lady, that did me good. Haven&#8217;t had such
a thorough housecleaning of my mean thoughts in quite
a spell. Feel all ready for a fresh voyage under the
new captain. You rest run along and find that long
sufferin&#8217; mother of yours and tell her the coast&#8217;s clear
of that pirate craft. We&#8217;ve all shipped men-o&#8217;-war,
now, and run up the old flag of truth and love. That
was the banner your father floated from his masthead,
and the colors that&#8217;ll never dip to lying or cheating.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
Wait. I&#8217;ll pack this baby Luis to his bed. Poor little
castaway, that your good father picked up in the canyon
and fetched home in his arms, to share the best with
his own. Well, needn&#8217;t tell me that the family of a
man as good as he was&#8217;ll ever come to want. Heave
ahead, captain. Show me the track to sail.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica stopped to bid the other ranchmen good-night,
then led the sailor to the little bedroom which
the lads shared in common, and where Ned was already
asleep, tucked in his white cot by his mother, who let
no personal grief interfere with her care for others.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-night, dear Samson. I must find that paper.
You must help me. My mother must not, shall not,
lose her home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never. Good-night, captain. You&#8217;ve a good crew
on deck and we&#8217;ll make happy haven yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was Jessica Trent&#8217;s first wakeful night. Though
she tried to lie quietly in her own little bed, lest she
should disturb her mother whose room she shared, she
fancied all sorts of strange sounds, both in-doors and
out; and whenever she dropped into a doze, dreamed
of the missing paper and of searching for it.</p>

<p>One dream was so vivid that she woke, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother! I&#8217;ve found it. The black tin box under
the three sharp rocks!&#8221;</p>

<p>But her eyes opened upon vacancy, and there was no
response from the larger bed where her anxious parent
had, at last, fallen asleep. Yet the vision remained,
painted upon the darkness, as it were, a sun-lighted
glowing spot, with three pyramidal rocks and a clump
of scraggly live oaks. A spot she had never seen,
indeed, but felt that she should instantly recognize,
should she come upon it anywhere.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>Then she curled back upon her pillows and again shut
her eyes.</p>

<p>Could it be possible that she, a healthy little girl,
was growing fidgety, like Aunt Sally Benton, who
sometimes came to visit her son and help with the
sewing? For she surely was hearing things. Movements,
hushed footfalls, softly closing doors, creaking
floors, at an hour when all the household should be at
rest.</p>

<p>&#8220;How silly! It may be somebody is ill! Wun Lung&#8217;s
hand may hurt him, though it seemed so nearly well,
and nobody else would have minded it. That stranger!
Yes, I fancy it&#8217;s he. He may need something that I
can get him, and I&#8217;ll go inquire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slipping a little wrapper over her gown, but in her
bare feet, the girl noiselessly left the room and followed
the sound she had heard. These led her to a
small apartment which her father had used as an office
and where stood the desk in whose secret drawer she
had expected to find the title deed. A small fireproof
safe was in this office. It was an old-fashioned affair,
with a simple, but heavy key, which the Sobrante
children had played with in their infancy. She remembered
her father remarking, with a laugh, that a safe
was the most useless thing he possessed, for he never
had anything worth putting in it; but it had been a
belonging of old &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; Marsh, a gift to his
employer, and therefore accorded a place of honor.</p>

<p>Before this safe now bent a man whom Jessica recognized
with surprise and relief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Marsh! Is it you? What in the world
are you doing here at this hour? Are you ill? Do you
want something?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>&#8220;No, dearie. I&#8217;m not ill; and I&#8217;m not robbing you.
And I&#8217;ve got all I want. That&#8217;s one more look at your
bonny face, God bless it!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was close to his shoulder now, that face he loved,
and he kissed it tenderly; though with equal tenderness,
if less emotion, the little maid returned his caress
and clasped his neck with those strong, young arms
that so yearned to protect and comfort everybody.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s funny. Should think you&#8217;d be tired of it,
sometimes, I disappoint you so. But never mind. I&#8217;m
getting handier with my new rifle every day, I think,
and I mean to do yet what Samson claims I should&#8211;just
beat the world. Have you finished looking at your
things?&#8221; For it was Mr. Marsh himself who had
always used the safe, even after giving it away. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
I get you something to eat, so you can sleep better?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dearie, no, just one more good kiss&#8211;to remember.
Good-by. Good-by. It&#8211;it might have been done
kinder, maybe, but&#8211;her heart is sad, I know, and her
first thought is for you. She must save for you. Here,
Lady, take the key. Some time you&#8211;you might want
to look in that safe for yourself. Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica went with him to the outer door, wondering
much at this oddly-timed visit. Yet the ranchman
walked erect, still carrying his lighted candle quite
openly, as one who had done nothing of which to be
ashamed; and when he had departed the girl returned
to her own bed still more wakeful because of this queer
incident.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, it may have been, she heard the
limping footfall of a slowly-moving horse, the echoes
growing fainter continually.</p>

<p>Again she sat up and listened.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Mr. Marsh&#8217;s &#8216;Stiffleg!&#8217; What should send
him off riding now? Oh! I do wish mother was awake,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
things seem so queer. Yet I don&#8217;t really wish it. She
has so many wakeful nights and just this one is more
than I want. Now, Jessica Trent, don&#8217;t be foolish any
longer. Go straight to sleep or you&#8217;ll be late in the
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nature acted upon this good advice, and Our Lady
knew no more till a pair of chubby hands were pulling
her curls and Ned&#8217;s voice was screeching in her ear:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, Jessie Trent. We had our breakfast
hours ago, and the &#8216;boys&#8217; is all out-doors, can&#8217;t go to
work &#8217;ithout their captain. That&#8217;s <i>me</i>, Jessie Trent,
&#8217;cause I&#8217;m the &#8216;heir.&#8217; Samson said so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;s the heir, Samson said so!&#8221; echoed Luis from
the floor where he was trying the fit of Jessica&#8217;s new
&#8220;buckskins&#8221;&#8211;the comfortable moccasin-like footgear
which Pedro made for her&#8211;upon his own stubby toes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He, he! What&#8217;s the heir Samson said? You&#8217;re a
stupid, Luis Garcia.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stupid Garcia!&#8221; laughed the little mimic, not in the
least offended.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, run away then, laddies, and I&#8217;ll be ready in a
jiffy. Poor mother. To think that I should have left
her to do so much alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>As she threw open the sash of the rear window, Jessica
started back, surprised; for there, reined close to
the porch, was Nero&#8217;s black form, with the dark face
of his master bending low over the saddle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, senorita, and good fortune. Those
who hid may find. I kiss your hand in farewell, and
may it rule in peace till I return, I myself, the master.
One month hence I come, bringing my servants with
me. <i>Adios.</i> Ah! but what did you and the old sharpshooter
at the office safe at midnight? <i>When the senora
would seek her title, seek him.</i> It is farewell.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>CAPTAIN JESS</span></h2>

<p>Jessica drew back, repelled. Why did that man make
her so unhappy whenever she saw him nowadays?
What did he mean by that speech about old Ephraim
Marsh and the safe? Well, he was gone, riding swiftly
away and lightening her trouble with every rod of
ground he put between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not come for a month, he said, and by that
time everything will be straight. If Sobrante is ours
it cannot possibly be his. That&#8217;s simple. Though he
might have lived here always if he&#8217;d wished. The title
paper has been mislaid. That&#8217;s all. I&#8217;m sure to find it
when I have time to look thoroughly, and how different
things do seem by daylight. Now, to say good-morning
to the &#8216;boys,&#8217; dear fellows, and then for breakfast.
I&#8217;m as hungry as on ostrich.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though since sunrise each had been busy about his
accustomed duties, neglecting nothing because of the
change in command, it suited the ideas of these faithful
ranchmen to report for duty to their newly appointed
&#8220;captain&#8221; and to ask for orders from her. With the
ready intuition of childhood she fell in with their mood
at once and received them in a manner which robbed
the affair of burlesque and invested it with dignity.</p>

<p>From a shaded corner of the porch, from behind his
book, Mr. Hale watched the scene with an amusement
that soon gave place to wonder and admiration. They
were all profoundly in earnest. The fair young girl
with folded arms and serene composure, poised at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
head of the steps and the group of sunburned workmen
standing respectfully before her.</p>

<p>By tacit consent Samson was spokesman for the company
and his words had their usual nautical tinge.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ready to set sail, captain, and here&#8217;s wishing
good luck to the v&#8217;yge! Old &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; hasn&#8217;t
showed up on deck yet, but he&#8217;ll likely soon heave to,
and the rest the crew&#8217;ll vouch for his being a good
hand in any sort o&#8217; storm we&#8217;re apt to strike. We&#8217;ve
overhauled this chart. Each of us solemnly promise to
abide and obey no orders but yours, captain, or the
admiral&#8217;s through you. And would respectfully suggest&#8211;each
man sticks to the post he&#8217;s always filled,
till ordered off it by his superior officer. Right, mates?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ay, ay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s that suit you, commodore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That suits me, Samson. It will suit my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As for pay&#8211;being as we&#8217;ve got along without any
these five months back, and Senor Top-Lofty&#8217;s rode
off, forgettin&#8217; to leave them arrears we mentioned, we
wash the slate clean and start all over again. For five
months to come we&#8217;ll serve you and the admiral for
mess and berth, no more, no less.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Samson, do you mean that? Haven&#8217;t you boys been
paid your wages regularly, just as in my father&#8217;s time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, now, captain, that&#8217;s all right. Give us the
word of dismissal and let that slide. You missed your
own mess this morning<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that will break my mother&#8217;s heart. I know! I
know! I&#8217;ve often heard her ask him, and Antonio tell
her&#8211;he said that your wages were always taken out
before he brought what little money he could to her.
I know you said something about &#8216;arrears&#8217; last night,
but I didn&#8217;t understand. What are &#8216;arrears,&#8217; Samson?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>&#8220;Blow me, for an old numskull. Why couldn&#8217;t I
keep my long tongue still! I only meant that we are
willing, we want, we must work for you and all the
Trents for nothing till we&#8217;ve made up part to &#8217;em of
what that sweet &#8216;senor&#8217; cheated &#8217;em of. That&#8217;s all.
We&#8217;ve settled it. No use for anybody to try change
our minds, even if there was spot cash lying around
loose, waiting to be picked up and you havin&#8217; no call
for it. Not one of which conditions hits the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are a good talker, dear old Samson, and a long
one. I can talk, too, sometimes. Maybe you&#8217;ve heard
me! You&#8217;ve read me your chart. Hear mine. It&#8217;s
my father&#8217;s own&#8211;that he always meant, but was never
able to follow. That I know my mother wants to follow
for his sake, though she does know so little of
business. Now, if we&#8217;re starting fresh, with the clean
slates you like, we&#8217;ll put this at the top: &#8216;share and
share alike.&#8217; There was another long name dear father
used to call it&#8211;I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Co-operation,&#8221; suggested John Benton.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. That&#8217;s it. As soon as he was out of debt
and had a right to do what he would with Sobrante,
he meant to run it that way. But you know, you know.
It was only that last day when he came home so late
from that far-off town that he had his own &#8216;title&#8217; and
was all ready to do as he wished. Let us do that now.
I know how. He told me. He was to make you,
Samson, responsible for all the cattle on the ranch.
You were to hire as many of the other boys as you
needed and were to have a just share for your own
money. The more you made out of the cattle the
better it would be for yourself. Isn&#8217;t that right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right to a dot. Atlantic! but you&#8217;ve a head for
business, captain!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a head must learn business, if I&#8217;m to be your
captain. That is true enough. It isn&#8217;t my father&#8217;s fault
if I don&#8217;t know some simple things. He was always
teaching me, because Ned was too little and my mother&#8211;well, business always worried her and he&#8217;d do anything
to save her worry, even talk to a little girl like
me. And as Samson was to do with the cattle, so
George Cromarty was to do with the raisins and
oranges. The ostriches&#8211;Oh! but they were to be Antonio&#8217;s
charge. And now<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re yours, captain, with any one or lot of us
you choose for helpers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ferd knew much about them, and they minded him.
But<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ferd&#8217;ll trouble Sobrante none while the senor is
away. Joe is a good hand at all live stock, and I&#8217;ll
pledge you&#8217;ll get every feather that&#8217;s plucked when he
does the counting. He won&#8217;t let any eggs get cooked in
hatchin&#8217;, neither. You can trust Joseph&#8211;if you watch
him a mite.&#8221;</p>

<p>A laugh at honest Joe&#8217;s expense, in which he heartily
joined, followed this and Lady Jess stepped down
among her friends, holding out her hands to first one,
then another. Her blue eyes were filled with happy
moisture, for she was not too young to feel their devotion
to be as unselfish as it was sincere, and her
smile was full of confidence in them and in herself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleven years old is pretty early to be a captain, I
guess, but I&#8217;ll be a good one&#8211;just as good and true as
you are! What I don&#8217;t know you&#8217;ll teach me, and if I
make mistakes you&#8217;ll be patient, I know. One thing I
can do, I can copy bills and papers. I can put down
figures and add them up. It was good practice for me,
my father said. So I&#8217;ll put down your names and all
your business in these new books he bought and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
going to use in his co&#8211;co-operation&#8211;is that right,
John?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right as a trivet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And our admiral, that&#8217;s the dear mother, will not
have to fret so any longer. Between us we&#8217;ll make
Sobrante all my father meant it should be and&#8211;as
soon as I have my breakfast&#8211;I will find that title. I
must find it. I will. Sobrante is yours and ours forever.
Oh, boys, I love you! I&#8217;m all choked up&#8211;I love
you so and I feel like that my father used to read in
Dickens: &#8216;God bless you every one!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>With her hands clasped close against her breast, and
her beloved face luminous with her deep affection, their
little maid stood before her hardy henchmen, a symbol
to them of all that was best and purest in life. Their
own eyes were moist, and even Mr. Hale had to take off
his glasses and wipe them as, looking around upon his
comrades, great Samson swung his hat and cried:</p>

<p>&#8220;And may God bless Our Lady Jess! And may
every man who seeks to injure her be&#8211;stricken with
numb palsy! And may every crop be doubled, prices
likewise! Peace, prosperity and happiness to Sobrante&#8211;destruction to her enemies!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgiveness for her enemies, Samson, dear, if there
really are. That will be nobler, more like father&#8217;s rule.
Make it peace, prosperity and happiness to all the
world! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale clapped his hands to his ears, then hastily
moved forward and joined in the cheer, that was deafening
enough to have come from many more throats
than uttered it. Yet he had an uncomfortable feeling
that he might be classed among those &#8220;enemies&#8221; whom
Samson wished afflicted with numb palsy and that, at
that moment, he was, by no fault of his own, playing
a double part.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>But he gave himself the benefit of the doubt until he
should learn, as he meant to do at once, the whole history
of Sobrante with its strange hodge-podge of industries,
its veteran employees, and its childish &#8220;captain.&#8221;
So, while the ranchmen dispersed to their business
and Jessica sought her long-delayed breakfast, he turned
towards the kitchen where he hoped to find the mistress
of the ranch.</p>

<p>But he was disappointed. There was visible only the
broad, purple-covered back and black pig-tail of a
Chinaman, pounding away at the snowy loaves of his
kneading-board, as if they were &#8220;enemies&#8221; of his own
and deserving something much worse than &#8220;numb
palsy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wun Lung!&#8221;</p>

<p>No answer, save the whack, whack, whack of the tormented
dough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem. I say, John!&#8221;</p>

<p>Whack, whack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wun Lung, where&#8217;s your mistress?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dlaily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed? I fancy your hand is better. I&#8217;m glad of
it. That bread ought to be fine. At your leisure, kindly
point the direction of the &#8216;dlaily,&#8217; will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>One yellow, floury hand was lifted and extended
eastward, but as this signified nothing definite to the
stranger he continued his inquiries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Pasqual?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sclub.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the little boys?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alle glone.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>&#8220;I congratulate you on your English, though I&#8217;m uncertainly
whether you mean me to &#8216;go on&#8217; or assert that
somebody else has gone on. I don&#8217;t like to disturb
Miss Jessica at breakfast, but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Back polchee,&#8221; suggested Wun Lung, anxious to be
rid of the intruder, whose irony he suspected if he did
not understand.</p>

<p>Mr. Hale betook himself around the house, and, fortunately,
in the right direction; for just issuing from
her dairy, which was in a cellar under the cottage,
was Mrs. Trent, bearing a wooden bowl of freshly
made butter.</p>

<p>The guest&#8217;s heart smote him as he saw her sad face
brighten at meeting him, for he knew she trusted him
for help he was in duty bound to give elsewhere. But
it was not a lawyer&#8217;s habit to anticipate evil, and he was
thankful for her suggestion.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should have a ride this fine morning, Mr. Hale,
before the sun is too high. I&#8217;ve ordered a horse brought
round for you at nine o&#8217;clock, and Jessica shall act your
guide, on Scruff. That is&#8211;if the laddies haven&#8217;t already
disappeared with him. Ah! here comes my girl,
herself. You are to show our friend as much of Sobrante
as he cares to see, in one morning, daughter. If
the children have ridden the burro off you may have
Buster saddled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shan&#8217;t you need me, mother? One of the men<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dear. Wun Lung is at his post again and
Pasqual will do the milk and things. But as you go, I&#8217;d
like you to take this butter to John&#8217;s. It&#8217;s the weekly
portion for the men, who mess for themselves,&#8221; she
explained to the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lucky men to fare on such golden balls as those!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span>&#8220;Come and see my dairy. I&#8217;m very proud of it. You
know, I suppose, that cellars are rarities in California.
Everything is built above ground, in ordinary homes;
but I needed a cooler place for the milk, and my husband
had this planned for me. See the water, our
greatest luxury; piped from an artesian well to the tank
above, and then down through these cooling pipes
around the shelves. After such use supplying the
garden, for whatever else may be wasted here it is
never a drop of water. Will you taste the buttermilk?
I can&#8217;t give you ice, but we cool it in earthen crocks
sunk in the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>More and more did the lawyer&#8217;s admiration for his
hostess increase. She displayed the prosaic details of
her dairy with the same ease and pride with which she
would have exhibited the choicest bric-a-brac of a
sumptuous drawing-room, and her manner impelled
him to an interest in the place which he would have
found impossible under other circumstances. But
above all he wondered at the unselfishness with which
she set aside her own anxieties and gave herself wholly
to the entertainment of her guest.</p>

<p>&#8220;The loss of that title deed means ruin for her and
her family&#8211;even if I were not also compelled to bring
distress upon her. But she does not whine nor complain,
and that&#8217;s going to make my task all the harder.
Well, first to see this ranch, and then&#8211;I wish I&#8217;d never
come upon this business! Better suffer nervous dyspepsia
all the rest of my life than break such a woman&#8217;s
heart. Her husband may have been a scamp of the
first water, but she&#8217;s a lady and a Christian. So is
that beautiful little girl, and it&#8217;s from her I mean to
get all my needed information.&#8221;</p>

<p>Absorbed in thoughts that were far from pleasant,
the gentleman walked beside Mrs. Trent to the horseblock,
and mounted the horse which a gray-haired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
stable &#8220;boy&#8221; was holding for him, all without rousing
from the preoccupation that held him. It was not till
he heard Jessica&#8217;s excited call coming over the space
between the cottage and the &#8220;quarters&#8221; that he realized
where he was and looked up, expectant.</p>

<p>The little girl who had left them for a few moments,
was galloping toward them on the back of a rough-coated
broncho, waving a paper in her hand and with
distressed indignation, crying out as she came:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; has gone. Dear old &#8216;Forty-niner!&#8217; I
found this letter in his room and it&#8217;s forever&#8211;forever!
Oh, mother! And he says <i>you</i> discharged him&#8211;or it
means that&#8211;without show of chance! Mother, mother,
how could you? That dear old man that everybody
loved!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Discharged him&#8211;I? I should as soon have thought
of discharging myself! What fresh distress is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>Catching the paper from Jessica&#8217;s hand Mrs. Trent
read it, then turned and without a word walked slowly
into the house. But her head was giddy and her limbs
trembled, and she had a strange feeling as if she were
being swiftly inclosed in a net from which she could not
escape.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>IN THE MINER&#8217;S CABIN</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, mother! I oughtn&#8217;t to have told it that
way. But what does it mean? Why should you want
him to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you not hear me say I would not have dismissed
him? No, dear. There is something in this I don&#8217;t
understand. How do we know but that all the other
&#8216;boys&#8217; who left so suddenly have been deceived in just
this way? As long as there was food enough to eat and
a roof to shelter them the men whom your father befriended
and who, in turn have befriended us, were as
welcome to Sobrante as my own children. I must think
this over. We must then find Ephraim and bring him
back. We must. There! We&#8217;ll not discuss it any
more at present. You are keeping Mr. Hale waiting
and that is rudeness. Go, now, and explain all your father&#8217;s
plans to him, as you ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d so much rather stay with you. I don&#8217;t like to
leave you now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be busy and you&#8217;ll be back for dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to look for that paper&#8211;the title.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, then, and don&#8217;t do any hard work. I&#8217;ll
send the children up to stay around the house. That
will be one worry off your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she had again sprung into her saddle, Lady
Jess apologized for keeping Mr. Hale so long, and suggested:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>&#8220;Suppose we ride first to the mines, while it is coolest.
Then come around by the olive and orange orchards.
We can rest at the lemon house awhile. It&#8217;s interesting
to see how they are cared for, or so most strangers
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything and anywhere suits me, for I&#8217;m full of
curiosity about Sobrante. How did your father happen
to take up so many different lines of industry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, they were all his &#8216;experiments.&#8217; You see he
wanted to do good to some sorts of people that nobody
else seemed much interested in. Men that were getting
old and were not rich or well. He was born in California,
and he always thought it the land where everybody
could find a place if he only had a chance. He
went to New York and lived a long time, and he and
mother were married there. He&#8217;d once ridden over
this valley, on a horseback trip&#8211;just like yours, maybe&#8211;and after that he always meant to buy it if he could.
So, when he began to lose his own health he came right
away. He hadn&#8217;t much money himself, but he worked
and mother helped, and he&#8217;d paid for it all before he
died. It was the title deed which proved it, that he
had just brought home and I could not find last night.
Though, of course, I shall find it yet,&#8221; she added confidently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, my child. I devotedly hope so. Yet if
it was duly recorded the matter should easily be set
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s face fell.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it was. He said something about
that, I didn&#8217;t understand it quite, but I know he said
&#8216;recorded&#8217; and that he meant to have it done the next
time he went to Los Angeles. But&#8211;he didn&#8217;t ever go.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lawyer&#8217;s face grew still more serious. Something
of the love with which she inspired everybody was already
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
in his heart for this little maid, and thoughts of
his own young daughters, threatened with the misfortune
which menaced her, stirred him to fresh regret
for the mission he had undertaken.</p>

<p>They had now turned their horses&#8217; heads toward the
foothills on the north and he asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What are these &#8216;mines&#8217; of which you speak?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For coal. It was an old man from Pennsylvania
first thought there might be such stuff in the mountains
near, and it&#8217;s worth so much here. Father had found
him in one of the towns, with his wife and sick son.
They&#8217;d spent all they had, to come West to try to cure
the son, and were very poor. So, of course, father
brought them to Sobrante, and the boy got better at
once. They didn&#8217;t understand any sort of work except
mining, and old Wolfgang couldn&#8217;t rest without trying
to do something back for father. So he and Otto dug
and picked around till they found a &#8216;vein&#8217; and then
they put up a little cabin near and there they live. Their
name is Winkler, and Elsa, the mother, is the quaintest
little Dutchwoman. Of course, there&#8217;s never been
money enough to work the mine right. All they can
do is to get out enough coal for us to use. That&#8217;s why
we always have such lovely grate fires in the winter
time, that make the house so cosy. You&#8217;ll like the
Winklers, and you&#8217;ll like Elsa&#8217;s coffee. Go there what
time of day you will she always makes you drink some,
sweetened with the wild honey she gets in the hills
and with her goat&#8217;s milk in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale made a wry face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you&#8217;re sure to like it. It is delicious, drank
with a slice of her hard, sweetened bread. And their
little cabin is as clean as can be. Elsa is a great knitter.
She has knitted covers for everything, her beds, chairs,
table, everything. All the furniture is made out of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
wood they found in the hills, and when they&#8217;re not
mining Otto carves it beautifully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are all the people who work for you unfortunate?
I mean, was some misfortune that which made your
father engage them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, just that. They are his &#8216;experiments.&#8217; He
said this valley was made for every sort of work there
was to be done. All men can&#8217;t be the same thing, and
every man was happiest at his own trade. Young men
can get work anywhere, but dear Sobrante is a Home
with a capital H, for anybody who needs one. My father
said the more he trusted people the less they ever
disappointed him. He&#8217;d proved his plan was right on
his own single ranch and he was trying to make others
do the same on theirs. Paraiso d&#8217;Oro&#8211;oh! you&#8217;re
from that same New York. Do you know a&#8211;a Mr.
Syndicate, I think he was, who owns Paraiso. Of
course, I know in such a big city you might not, though
maybe<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The listener started, then looked keenly into the innocent
face bending toward him from the broncho&#8217;s
back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose I do know a syndicate&#8211;a company&#8211;not
an individual, which is interested in Paraiso? Can you
tell me anything about such a place? Until last night
I had no idea that I had come anywhere near to it, and
then by accident, hearing Antonio Bernal mention it as
his. Is it hereabouts?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica turned her horse about in a circle, rapidly
swinging her pointing arm to indicate every direction
of the compass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Know it? It is there, and there, and there&#8211;everywhere.
The very richest tract of land in all the country,
my father believed. Sobrante is the heart of it,
he said, but the rest of the valley is even better than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
Sobrante. It is so big one can hardly believe. He
said there was room in it, and a little ranch apiece, for
every poor down-trodden man&#8211;not bad men, but
poor gentlemen, like worn-out lawyers and doctors and&#8211;and nice folks&#8211;and make a new home in which to
live at peace. He said there were plenty of people always
ready to help the very poor and ignorant, but nobody
so willing to help gentlefolks without money.
That&#8217;s why he asked a lot of rich people he used to
know in New York to buy Paraiso. He gave it its
name, himself, and he believed that there might be
really gold somewhere in it. There&#8217;s everything else,
you see. But it was a name of &#8216;syndicate&#8217; he talked
about most and was most grieved by because the money
to buy it had not been sent as it had been promised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor child!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nothing. I was thinking. So this &#8216;Mr.
Syndicate&#8217; never sent the money your father hoped
for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. It was a great disappointment. Antonio had
charge of all the letters, only he; so there could have
been nobody careless enough to lose them had any
come. Father left all the writing to Antonio, for he
was nearly blind, you know. That&#8217;s how he came to
get hurt. He could not see and his horse stepped over
the ledge and somebody brought him home that way.
Poor mother!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor mother, indeed!&#8221; echoed Mr. Hale, with something
like a groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for caring about it,&#8221; said Jessica, quickly
touched by his ready sympathy. &#8220;But she says her life
now must be to carry on all father&#8217;s work, and I shall
help her. In that way it will be always as if he were
still with us. Oh! see! That&#8217;s Stiffleg&#8217;s track! Ephraim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
Marsh has passed this way! Maybe I shall find
him at the Winklers&#8217; cabin! Would you mind hurrying,
just a little bit?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best, little lady. But I&#8217;m a wretched
horseman, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you&#8217;ll learn. If you would only let yourself
be easy and comfortable. But, beg pardon, you do it
this way&#8211;so stiff, with your hands all clinched. Your
horse feels that something&#8217;s wrong, and that&#8217;s why he
fidgets so. You should get Samson to show you how.
He&#8217;s a magnificent rider. I&#8217;ll coax him to do some
tricks for you, to-night, when we get through supper.
I&#8217;m off. Just drop all care and let the horse do the
work and&#8211;catch me if you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they approached the foothills they had dropped
into a little hollow where the sandy ground was moist
and retained an impression distinctly, and it was thus
that Jessica&#8217;s keen eyes discovered the peculiar footprints
of &#8220;Forty-niner&#8217;s&#8221; halting steed. But she quickly
forgot these in the interest of the race she had
started and was now bent upon nothing save beating
Mr. Hale at the goal, the miner&#8217;s cabin.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has by far the better horse. He ought to win,
but he shall not&#8211;he can&#8217;t. He mustn&#8217;t! Go, Buster!
A taste of Elsa&#8217;s honey if you get there first!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bending forward the girl rested her cheek against
the broncho&#8217;s neck and, as if the touch fired him with
new ambition, he shot forward so swiftly that the question
of winning was soon settled. However, Mr. Hale&#8217;s
own pride was touched, and he put to the test the advice
just given him, and with such good results that
he, too, soon came in sight of a small house at the end
of the trail, a dark hole in the mountain side, and a
group of people eagerly surrounding his little guide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span>Indeed, Elsa had already drawn the child upon her
capacious lap, and was tenderly smoothing the tumbled
curls with her hard hand, while she asked endless questions,
yet waited for no answers.</p>

<p>Till, suddenly remembering, Lady Jess demanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;But have you seen our Ephraim? Is he here? Has
he been here?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elsa&#8217;s fat form grew quite rigid and her hand ceased
its caressing stroke. Not for her to betray the confidence
of one who had taken refuge with her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why ask that? What if he has and is? Is he not
the old man, already? Even here there is no room for
the old. When one is fifty one should die. That would
be wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Elsa Winkler, nonsense! That&#8217;s not polite for me
to say, but it&#8217;s true. You&#8217;re fifty, yourself, I guess,
and you don&#8217;t want to die, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elsa shivered slightly. &#8220;When the right time comes
and the usefulness is past. As the Lord wills.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica laughed and kissed the woman&#8217;s cheek, then
sprang to the ground, demanding:</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he? For he&#8217;s mine, you know. He belongs
to Sobrante just as much the sunshine does. If
he&#8217;d loved us as we love him he&#8217;d not have ridden away
in the night time just because of one little bit o&#8217; note.
Wherever you&#8217;ve hidden him you must find him for
me, and he&#8217;s to go straight away back with me. With
us, I mean, for here comes a&#8211;a friend of ours; I guess
he is. Any way he&#8217;s a guest and you must make him a
cup of your very best coffee, and Otto must show him
his carved clock that he is making. He&#8217;s a pleasant
gentleman, and so interested in everything, it&#8217;s fun to
tell him things. In that New York, where he came
from, they don&#8217;t have much of anything nice. No ostriches,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
nor mines, nor orange groves. Fancy! and he
doesn&#8217;t know&#8211;he&#8217;s only just learning to ride a horse!&#8221;</p>

<p>As Mr. Hale now approached, this description ceased
and Jessica presented him to her mountain friends:</p>

<p>&#8220;This is dear Elsa Winkler, and &#8216;her man,&#8217; Wolfgang.
And Otto&#8211;where&#8217;s Otto gone? He needn&#8217;t be
shy. Mr. Hale would like to see the carvings and the
knittings, and maybe, go down the shaft. But first
of all, he&#8217;d like the coffee, Elsa, dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>The portly Dutchwoman, whose needles could click
as fast as her tongue, now thrust the stocking, at
which she had resumed working the moment Jessica
left her lap, into her apron pocket and waddled inside
the cabin. Already she was beaming with hospitality
and calling in harsh chiding to the invisible Otto:</p>

<p>&#8220;You bad little boy, where are you at already? Come
by, soon&#8217;s-ever, and lay the dishes. Here&#8217;s company
come to the house and nobody but the old mother got a
grain of sense left to mind them. Wolfgang! Wolfgang!
Hunt the child and set him drawing a tether o&#8217;
milk from Gretchen, the goat. Ach! but it shames my
good heart when my folks act so foolish, and the Lady
Jess just giving the orders so sweet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wolfgang heard his wife&#8217;s commands and obeyed
them after his own manner, by lifting his mighty voice
and shouting in his native <i>patois</i>&#8211;&#8220;Little heart!
Son of my love! Come, come hither.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he did not, for all that, cease from his respectful
attention to the stranger, for whom he had promptly
brought out the best chair he owned, and whose horse
he had taken to a shaded spot and carefully rubbed
down with a handful of dried grass.</p>

<p>Presently, the &#8220;child&#8221; appeared, and the Easterner
flashed a smile toward Jessica, whose own face was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
dimpled with mirth; for the &#8220;child,&#8221; Otto, proved to be
a gaunt six-footer, lean as he was long, and with a
manly beard upon his pink and white face. He shambled
forward on his great feet and shyly extended his
mighty hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Hale grasped them heartily, eager to put the
awkward youth at ease; and, nodding toward the chair
from which he had risen, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8220;So, you are he who does that beautiful carving! I
congratulate you on your skill, and I hope you will
have some trifle of your work to sell a traveler. I&#8217;ve
never seen finer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Otto flushed with pleasure and was about to reply,
but again Elsa commanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Milk the goat, little one. After the guest feeds let
the household talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>As if he had been the &#8220;child,&#8221; the &#8220;little heart,&#8221;
his parents called him he obediently entered the cabin,
tied an apron before his lank body and spread a tablecloth.
Then, as deftly as if he had been a girl, he arranged
it with the three cups and plates the family
possessed, took his mother&#8217;s cherished spoons from
her chest, and, taking a small pail, sought the goat,
Gretchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m in for it,&#8221; thought Mr. Hale, regretfully.
&#8220;My poor dyspepsia! Coffee, honey, and goat&#8217;s milk!
A combination to kill. But even if it is, one must respond
to such whole-souled hospitality as this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica had no such qualms; and, indeed, the refreshment
which her visitor forced himself to accept was far
more palatable than he had dared expect; and, besides,
he now brought to it that astonishing appetite which
had come to him on this eventful trip. When the
luncheon was disposed of, Dame Elsa held an exhibition
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
of her wonderful knitting and it seemed to the
unappreciative stranger that a small fortune must have
been expended in yarns, and that even in this wilderness
one might be extravagant and wasteful.</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife would know more about such things than
I do, but I should think you might easily stock a whole
shop with your tidies and things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Man alive, do I not? Didst think it was for the
pleasure of one&#8217;s self the fingers are always at toil?
Ach! Yet, of course, how could a poor man from a
far city understand! It is Elsa&#8217;s knitting, and Elsa&#8217;s
only, will all the tourists have who come to Sobrante;
and in that Los Angeles, so distant, where the master
went but once every year already, there is a merchant
buys all. Ay. See here. I show you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t really care&#8211;I mean&#8211;ought we not to be
going, Jessica?&#8221; cried Mr. Hale, hopelessly, foreseeing
another exhibition of &#8220;trash,&#8221; as he considered it.</p>

<p>But Elsa could not conceive that everybody should
not be interested in all that concerned everybody else;
and, besides, this was quite another matter. One for
pride, indeed, beyond the accomplishment of the most
difficult &#8220;lacework&#8221; or &#8220;overshot&#8221; stitch.</p>

<p>From the same chest in which her precious half-dozen
plated spoons had reposed she now drew forth a
buckskin sack; and, from this, with radiant eyes fixed
on Mr. Hale&#8217;s own, another bag, knitted, of course,
and seemingly heavy. Sitting before him she spread
her own apron over her guest&#8217;s knees and poured therein
a goodly pile of gold and silver coins. With a little
catching of his own breath the lawyer realized that
among these were many eagles and double eagles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, this is wealth. This is <i>money</i>. I can see now,
after our paper bills and &#8216;checks&#8217; how real this seems.
You are a fortunate woman, Dame Elsa. Now, I begin
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
to respect your &#8216;tidies&#8217; and notions as things of moment.
Did you earn it all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach! wait. There is more already. This but begins;
and it is for the child. Some day, when there is
enough, he shall this mine buy and the machinery hire,
and the workmen. Then he will repay to the mistress
of Sobrante, and our Lady Jess, all that their dead man
spent for us. More. He will make the great money&#8211;this but leads the way. Wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trustful and eager of appreciation, which came so
rarely into her isolated life, the woman thrust her hand
again into the buckskin sack, her shining eyes still
fixed upon the stranger&#8217;s face, and her fingers fumbling
nervously in the depths of the narrow bag. Her
excitement and delight communicated itself to him, and
he found himself watching her broad, beaming face
with intense curiosity.</p>

<p>But&#8211;the face was changing. The light was dying
out of the sparkling eyes, an ashy color succeeding the
ruddy hue of the fat cheeks. Bewilderment, then
anxiety, then terror.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, good Elsa, what is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone&#8211;gone&#8211;but I am robbed, I am ruined! Mein
Gott, man! Little one&#8211;lost, lost, lost!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a shriek the poor creature sprang up, and in so
doing scattered far and wide the coins she had already
poured into her apron, but heeded nothing of this as
she rushed frantically out of doors.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT</span></h2>

<p>While Elsa had been entertaining the stranger within
doors Jessica had sought Wolfgang and compelled him,
by her coaxing, to admit that Ephraim Marsh had been
there and, also, that Antonio Bernal had ridden up that
morning to give orders about the coal.</p>

<p>&#8220;None of it is to be sent down to the ranch, he said,
no matter who calls for it, till he comes back. He was
going away for a time and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>How will you get on at
Sobrante without him, Lady Jess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wolfgang, better than with him. Listen. Look at
me. I&#8217;m the &#8216;manager&#8217; now. The captain. The &#8216;boys&#8217;
all elected me or made me, whatever way they fixed it.
I&#8217;m to be the master. I, just Jessica. Guess I&#8217;m
proud? Guess I&#8217;ll do the very, very best ever a girl can
do? Nobody is to be any different, though. You&#8217;re to
go on mining just the same and John Benton says, quite
often, it&#8217;s high time you had another hand to help up
here. He says with coal fifteen dollars a ton there&#8217;s
money in it, even if it is a weeny little mine. So, if you
want a man, any time, just let me know. Ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>With an amusing little strut that was mostly affectation
the girl passed up and down before the miner, and
ended her performance by a hearty hug. It was impossible
for her to withhold her caresses from anybody
who loved her; and who did not, at Sobrante, save Antonio
and Ferd, the dwarf? But she sobered quickly
enough and at Wolfgang&#8217;s petition to &#8220;Tell me all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
about it already,&#8221; gave him a vivid picture of the
changes at her home.</p>

<p>&#8220;But now Antonio has gone for a month, things will
get straightened all out again. When he comes back
I&#8217;ll have that deed to show him, and once he gets it out
of his vain head that he is owner and not my mother,
he&#8217;ll get sensible and good again, as he used to be. I
wish I liked him better. That would make it easier for
me to give up being &#8216;captain&#8217; when the time comes.
What makes one love some people and not others,
Wolfgang? You ought to know, you&#8217;ve lived a long
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The good God.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t make us dislike anybody. That can&#8217;t
be the right reason.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I know not. Though I am getting old I&#8217;m
not so wise, little one. But&#8211;ought I? Ought I not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you hark me. This Ephraim&#8211;guess you what
that Antonio said of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I? Yes, that&#8217;s not the truth. But
what he said was so dreadful I wouldn&#8217;t even tell my
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ach! A child should tell the mother all things.
Heed that. It is so we train our Otto.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Otto is no child. He is a grown man. He is bigger
than you. You should not shame him by keeping
him a boy always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pst! girl! I would not he heard you, for my life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll not hear. Elsa is talking. But what did Antonio
say about my old &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>&#8220;That much went with that old man besides his
boots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. The feet that were in them, I suppose.
Silly Wolfgang, to be so impressed by a sillier Antonio.
The boys say his Spanish maxims have little
sense in them. That proves it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This deed of yours. He said: &#8216;Where Ephraim,
the wicked, goes, goes their deed to the land.&#8217; And
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What more? The cruel, cruel man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That it mattered not already. He would come back,
the master. It was his, had always been. My friend&#8211;your
father&#8211;well, it was not we who listened. Nor
for once would Elsa make the cup of coffee she was
asked. Not a morsel got he here, save that the little
boy ran after him and gave him his own bit swiebach
lest he faint by the way. And that was the last word
of Antonio Bernal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s laughter was past. On her face there was
a trouble it grieved her old friend to see, and he hastened
to comfort her.</p>

<p>&#8220;If one goes, some are left already. Come now to
one whose eyes will be cured by a sight of your pretty
face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Ephraim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her hand to lead her, like the tender babe
he still considered her, and they passed behind the
cabin, toward the rickety shaft leading into the mine.
At its very mouth stood old Stiffleg, and in her delight
the girl gave him, too, one of her abounding hugs,
which called a comment from the miner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>&#8220;Beasts or humans, all one to your lips. Well, no
matter. It&#8217;s nature. Some are made that foolish way.
As for me&#8211;old horses<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wolfgang Winkler, shame! Now, sir, you&#8217;ll wait
till you ask before I kiss you again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I ask right quick. Now! Eh? No? Well,
before you go then, to prove you bear no malice; and
because I&#8217;ll show you a new vein I didn&#8217;t show Antonio.
Ach! He&#8217;ll mine his own coal when once he
comes&#8211;&#8216;the master&#8217;&#8211;as he said! And so I think,
though I know not, will all the others say. Sobrante
will not be Sobrante with us all gone. So?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not be gone. It is my mother&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is big and strong. He can plot evil, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wolfgang spoke as if he were disclosing a mystery
and not a fact well known to all who really knew the
Senor Bernal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be stronger. He shall not hurt my mother. I
will fight the world for her and for my brother!&#8221;</p>

<p>The miner had been arranging the rope upon the
windlass and now held the rude little car steady with
his foot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Step in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is he below? Down in the mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Already.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica needed no second bidding, but leaped lightly
into the car and Wolfgang followed her more cautiously.
He knew that was a forbidden delight to her,
for Mrs. Trent was nervously timid concerning such
visits, but, like her, felt that the present circumstances
justified the proceeding. Was not one below in the
darkness, nursing a broken heart? And was not it the
supreme business of each and all at Sobrante to comfort
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
the sorrowing? How else had he and his been
there, so happy and comfortable? So rich, also. Why,
Elsa had<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Jess! Get Elsa to show you the buckskin
bag! It has grown as fat as herself since you last saw
it. The child will own the mine some day, believe me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Moved by the thought he swiftly lowered away, and
as the car touched the bottom, the girl sprang out and
ran calling in the narrow tunnel:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim! My Ephraim! Where are you? I&#8217;ve
come for you, I, Jessica! It&#8217;s a dreadful mistake.
My mother&#8211;ah! here you are! Why down in this
horrid hole, Ephraim Marsh? You&#8217;re all shivering,
it&#8217;s so damp and dismal. For shame! To run away
from your best friends and never give them a chance to
tell you. Whoever wrote that note and sent you off
from your own home, it never was my mother. Never!
She said so, and it&#8217;s almost broken her heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite broken mine,&#8221; said the old frontiersman,
sobbing in his relief at having been thus promptly
sought and found by his beloved &#8220;lady.&#8221; For he did
not know it was quite by accident that she had stumbled
on this trace of him, nor did anybody enlighten
him. Whether she would have set him right or not she
had no chance, for, at that instant, they heard a hoarse
cry at the mouth of the shaft and saw the car, their
only means of ascent, moving swiftly out of reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heart of grace! Why that? Hark the woman!
&#8217;Tis the child! It is the little boy! Harm has befallen
and I&#8211;the father&#8211;I below in the ground!&#8221;</p>

<p>In his alarm Wolfgang danced about the narrow
space and wrung his hands, gazing frantically up the
shaft, catching hold of his companions and conducting
himself altogether like one bereft of common sense.
Which behavior was sufficient to restore Ephraim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
Marsh to his own self-command, and none too soon;
for the anxious father had already begun to try the ascent
by climbing up the timbered sides when, suddenly,
as if propelled by some extraordinary force the car
shot downward again. Before it really touched bottom
the shrieks had become deafening, and when Elsa
jumped out and rushed upon her husband, he clapped
his hands to his ears and retreated as far as the chamber
permitted.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has gone mad, already! The woman is dement!
Hark, the clamor!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he remembered his first fear and clutched his
wife&#8217;s arm, which promptly went around his neck and
threatened him with suffocation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, I never had no wife, but if I&#8217;d had I
wouldn&#8217;t cared to have her choke me to death a-loving
me, nor split my ears a-telling me of it,&#8221; commented
&#8220;Forty-niner,&#8221; dryly.</p>

<p>At which Elsa&#8217;s screams instantly ceased, and she
turned her attention upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it, thief? Give it up, this minute! How
could you rob me of my hard-earned money? That was
to buy the mine&#8211;and the vein runs deep&#8211;for my little
boy, my child! &#8217;Twas Antonio Bernal, the great man,
told us already of the deed you stole! But I believed
him not&#8211;I. Now, give me my money, my money&#8211;money!&#8221;</p>

<p>Overcome by her own violent emotion, rather than by
any opposition of poor Ephraim&#8217;s, her hands slid from
his shoulders, which she had been shaking as if she
would jingle the cash from his pockets, and her plump
person settled limply against him for support.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, here, woman! This is a drop too much!
Take the creature, Winkler, and find out if you can
what in misery ails her. She&#8217;s clean out of her wits.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>Instinctively, Jessica had placed herself at the old
sharpshooter&#8217;s side. He should feel that she did not
believe this terrible accusation, which recalled to her,
with painful significance, the parting words of Antonio
Bernal as he had ridden away from her window that
morning. These had practically accused him of stealing
the missing deed, and now came Elsa with this talk
of &#8220;money, money.&#8221; She brushed her hand across her
eyes as if to waken herself from some frightful dream
and then smiled up into Ephraim&#8217;s eyes, now bent inquiringly
upon her. Dim as the light was, there was
yet sufficient descending through the shallow shaft to
reveal each troubled face to the other, and the old man&#8217;s
own frightened at the confiding trust of his beloved
pupil&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind her. Let her scream and loll around,
if she wants to. What matters it? Little lady, am I or
am I not a&#8211;a&#8211;that pizen thing she called me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then come on. Let&#8217;s get out of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he was not to be permitted to escape so easily.
Elsa had now recovered her full strength and, oddly
enough, her composure. She waved her husband toward
the waiting car and he obeyed her gesture without
protest, gently lifting Jessica into it, for she would not
otherwise have been removed from Ephraim&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go with him, lady. Elsa won&#8217;t want to <i>live</i> down
here and we&#8217;ll follow presently. Never had a woman
seem so fond of my company, not in all my eighty
years. H-m-m!&#8221;</p>

<p>Commonly, the most genial of men, the sharpshooter&#8217;s
spirits had fully regained their normal poise.
Since he had not been dismissed by Mrs. Trent, and
since his little Jessica believed in him, everything was
all right. Elsa had been hoarding so long for her overgrown
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
&#8220;child&#8221; that she had lost her wits. He wasn&#8217;t
surprised. She was a woman.</p>

<p>So, with a smile, he was able to watch the car disappear
upward, and he even began to whistle, lest Elsa
should improve this opportunity and resume her racket.</p>

<p>&#8220;No disrespect to you, ma&#8217;am, remembering the good
victuals you&#8217;ve often given me, but kind of to keep
my courage up, like the boy going through the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elsa vouchsafed no reply, beyond grasping his sleeve
firmly, as if to assure herself that he should not vanish
through the solid wall behind them; and he, at least,
was relieved when the little car came rolling downward
again, empty.</p>

<p>Elsa, who understood its management as well as her
husband, grasped its side and motioned Ephraim forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ladies first,&#8221; he objected, gallantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get in, wretch, already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;m not loath to get in, now. Even your
sweet presence doesn&#8217;t make this hole a paradise. And
I came down here a heavy-hearted man, yet I&#8217;ve going
up light as a feather. Glad I&#8217;ve got you along to ballast,
else I&#8217;d likely shoot clean up to the sky.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Elsa thought his hilarity ill-timed. She glared
at him first, then began to weep, and her tears sobered
him as no frowns could do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, here, old girl, cheer up! Likely it&#8217;s only a
passing fit of madness has got you in tow. Women are
kittle cattle, I&#8217;ve been told. Except Lady Jess and the
madam. But they&#8217;re quality. It&#8217;s in their blood to be
noble just as &#8217;tis in&#8211;well, let that go. If you&#8217;ve lost
any of your money, as you &#8217;pear to think, you&#8217;ll find it
again. Why, you&#8217;re bound to. Who is there to steal it
save your own selves? Likely you&#8217;ve got up some dark
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
night in your sleep and hid it away so careful you&#8217;ve
forgot the place. Good! The top and fresh air again,
thank Heaven!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale had left the cabin immediately after Elsa,
and though inclined to stoop and gather up her scattered
coins had refrained from doing so, restrained by
that prudence which becomes second nature to lawyers.</p>

<p>&#8220;She thinks somebody has robbed her and would
probably accuse me of pocketing some of these. Too
much money for anybody to keep in a house,&#8221; he reflected,
forgetting that banks were not accessible to
everybody. &#8220;But it&#8217;s an ill wind, etc. Now I shall be
apt to escape that promised visit to an amateur coal
mine, and not endanger my life in their rickety car.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elsa&#8217;s conduct upon reaching home was as curious
and contradictory as ever. Instead of collecting her
scattered treasure, she merely said, with a shrug of her
fat shoulders:</p>

<p>&#8220;What good? let it lie. When the much is gone who
cares for the little?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she dropped into a chair and began again to
cry, disconsolately.</p>

<p>Jessica could not endure the scene.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I hate this! Elsa, stop. Be happy. Nobody
has robbed you. If there has &#8217;tis nobody here. I&#8217;m
going home. I was having such a good time and I&#8217;ve
found dear Ephraim. I&#8217;ll ask leave to come again to-morrow,
maybe, and you&#8217;ll have it by then. Just as I
shall the title. &#8217;Tis only that you&#8217;ve been careless, as&#8211;as
somebody else was. Good-by. We&#8217;re going. Say
good-by, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Elsa&#8217;s good-by was to seize Ephraim&#8217;s coat and hold
it with all her force, but he was now too happy to object
to this.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>&#8220;Certain, ma&#8217;am. If you&#8217;ve took a notion to it, I&#8217;ll
leave it with you. Coats don&#8217;t matter, when hearts are
light. Yes, look in the pockets. Like enough &#8217;twill
ease your mind a bit. I&#8217;d give her a dose of sagebrush
tea, Wolfgang. Catnip &#8217;d be better, but ain&#8217;t so handy.
Good-by, all. I&#8217;ll be &#8217;round again, myself, soon, if the
lady can spare me,&#8221; and with this remark, &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221;
quietly slipped out of the loose garment and
made his escape.</p>

<p>There was no more talk of inspecting the ranch. The
little party of three rode thoughtfully homeward. Even
Ephraim&#8217;s gayety had ebbed and the strange accusation
Elsa had made began at last to claim his serious attention.
Thieving was a new matter at Sobrante, though
he, along with all the other &#8220;boys,&#8221; had thought for
many months that the manager was dealing unfairly
by his mistress and employer. This affair would have
to be sifted to the bottom, and he didn&#8217;t like it. He was
glad to be going back to his familiar quarters, glad of
many things, yet his light-heartedness was quite gone.</p>

<p>Mr. Hale was equally silent and self-absorbed. Every
hour he spent among these people, like innocent children
all they seemed to him, but interested him the
more in them. Their unhappiness disturbed him and
yet his own mission was to make them more unhappy
still.</p>

<p>Jessica was angry, indignant, and amused by turns;
but these troubles were changing her swiftly from a
careless little girl to a sadly perplexed captain, and she
rode along in silence, for most of the way, forgetting
entirely that she had meant to take quite another route,
or that her present errand was to exhibit the wonders
of her beloved Sobrante.</p>

<p>They cantered peacefully downward across the valley,
old Stiffleg himself leading the way, till they struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
upon the main road and saw in the distance a vehicle
crawling forward upon it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! oh!&#8221; cried Jessica, who had been first to observe
this object.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heigho! What&#8217;s that&#8211;a circus?&#8221; asked Mr. Hale,
gazing curiously at the strange wagon.</p>

<p>Ephraim shaded his eyes with his hand and peered
into the distance. Then he dropped it, and drooping
ridiculously, groaned:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! my fathers!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a circus. All the colors of the rainbow,&#8221;
persisted Mr. Hale, glad of any diversion to his perturbed
thoughts.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis a circus, temperance union, a salvation army, a
woman&#8217;s rights convention, what Samson calls a Mother
Carey&#8217;s chicken, an Amazon, a wild Indian, a&#8211;a&#8211;shucks!
There isn&#8217;t anything on earth that yonder
doesn&#8217;t try a hand at. Land of Goshen! I&#8217;d almost
rather turn and go back to be jawed by the Dutchwoman.
And I&#8217;ve come home&#8211;just for this!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jessica was laughing as she had not laughed all
day, and if the person driving along in front was objectionable
to Ephraim it was evidently not the fact
in her case.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how glad I am!&#8221; she cried, and touched Buster
to his swiftest gallop, while the sharpshooter grimaced
and groaned:</p>

<p>&#8220;To have come back to this!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>AUNT SALLY</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Sally! Aunt Sally, wait for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>At the shrill cry and the clatter of Buster&#8217;s feet the
crawling vehicle came to a standstill, and from under
its canvas cover peered the smiling face of a hale,
elderly woman, whose gray head was bare save for its
abundant crown of curling hair. A straw Shaker bonnet,
with green curtains, hung over her shoulders. Her
print gown was of brilliant pink and her capacious
apron of blue gingham. She was collarless and her
sleeves were tucked above her round elbows, but she
was clean, as if just from a laundry. Indeed, at that
moment, her conveyance suggested such an institution
on wheels, for well-strung clotheslines were taut
against its sides, and from these fluttered freshly washed
garments and scraps of cloth.</p>

<p>Aunt Sally saw Jessica&#8217;s eyes, fasten upon these articles
and explained:</p>

<p>&#8220;Met a little water comin&#8217; along and used it. Never
know where you&#8217;ll be when you need water next&#8211;in
Californy. How&#8217;s all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, thank you. I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;ve come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a word to cure deafness. Here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman pulled a gigantic cookie from her apron
pocket and held it toward the girl, who had now come
alongside. The cake was in the shape of a doll, with
flaring skirt, and was promptly nibbled.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span>&#8220;Well, I declare! Eat your playmates, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, when you make them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that loping along behind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim, of course. Oh! yes. A Mr. Hale, from
New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he at here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just staying. Lost his way and making a visit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H-m-m! Don&#8217;t look wholesome. Needs picra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it. He has a great row of bottles in his
room and takes medicine every time he eats, or doesn&#8217;t.
That is, since he&#8217;s been at Sobrante, which isn&#8217;t long.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the wagon had halted on the road before them
Ephraim had turned to his companion, with a whimsical
smile, suggested:</p>

<p>&#8220;Better ride along as if we was glad to see her. It&#8217;s
like a dose of that bitter stuff she makes everybody
take, whether or no&#8211;get it over with. And she isn&#8217;t
so bad as&#8211;H-m-m.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale was not sorry to do this, for his curiosity
was roused. The wagon box was long and narrow, and
contained as many articles as would have sufficed a family
&#8220;crossing the plains&#8221; in the olden times. A kerosene
cooking stove, a cat in a parrot cage, a hencoop,
with mother and brood inside it, a trunk, a blanket and
pillow, a pail for watering the animals, and a box of tin
dishes. The cover, like a small &#8220;prairie schooner,&#8221; was
patriotic in extreme, shining with the national colors,
newly applied by Aunt Sally herself, and with no stingy
hand. The arrangement was also her own, and as she
considered, an improvement upon the flag; for she made
the whole top a field of stars, and the sides of the
stripes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>&#8220;Instead of a little weeny corner full of stars, that
you can count on your fingers, I&#8217;ve made a skyful right
overhead. I always thought if I&#8217;d had the designin&#8217; of
Old Glory, I&#8217;d have made it regular, like a patchwork
quilt&#8211;and nobody ever pieces a &#8216;block&#8217; that way.
Things must compare even, and so they would be if
women had had a hand in the business.&#8221;</p>

<p>This decorative turnout was drawn by a tandem
team, consisting of a milch cow and a burro, with the
cow in front. Which, after due introduction to the
stranger, she explained, regulated the behavior of both
animals.</p>

<p>&#8220;With Balaam in the middle, and him inclinin&#8217; to
balk, and Rosetty in front, it works double-action.
Them that use their wits is twice served. If he stops,
the wagon runs onto him, and if she&#8217;s in a movin&#8217; mood,
that drags him. If she gets lazy, he butts her and thus,
why&#8211;I&#8217;ve tried it both ways, changing their places
more&#8217;n once. This is the best. How you like Californy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come for your health?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Partly, for that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H-m-m. Folks with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve got no folks. Some hasn&#8217;t. Ephraim,
yonder, is one. He&#8217;d be in a fix if &#8217;twasn&#8217;t for
Jessie and me. I come about once in so often and
straighten out all the crooks. Took them pills, Ephy?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale tried to repress a smile and failed, but
&#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; burst into a loud laugh, and replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Aunt Sally, and what&#8217;s more I&#8217;m not going to.
Why should I? Who never have an ache or pain&#8211;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
medicine will cure,&#8221; he added, looking tenderly
upon Lady Jess and remembering his grief of the past
night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you ought to have. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t human nature to
live to eighty and not have. I&#8217;m twenty years younger&#8217;n
you are and I ache from head to foot, some days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Asking questions sort of wears you out, I reckon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Ephy, don&#8217;t get playful. Not at your age.
It&#8217;s not a good sign. Besides, my hen chicken&#8217;s been
crowing more&#8217;n once this trip. That&#8217;s a sign of death&#8211;somewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Giddap, Stiffleg!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim urged his horse forward, meaning to forewarn
the &#8220;boys&#8221; of who and what was coming. Jessica
comprehended and quickly followed, but her object
was to bespeak a different kind of welcome from that
he intended. Neither knew, then, just how heartily
glad they would be before many hours were over of the
helpful, yet disturbing, presence of this same masterful
woman.</p>

<p>The Easterner was left to jog alongside the curious
team and its more curious mistress, who, even, while
she held the rope reins in one hand, was threading her
needle and sewing that patchwork which was as characteristic
of her as the ceaseless knitting was of Elsa.</p>

<p>In fact, when one came to look at her closely, there
were seen assorted bits of cloth, fragments of some
&#8220;block,&#8221; pinned here and there about her person; and
as he watched her nimble fingers fly from one seam to
another the gentleman&#8217;s amazement found expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you manage to drive and sew at the same
time? And is it necessary?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re a Yankee yourself, aren&#8217;t you?
Well, if I hadn&#8217;t been able to manage how do you s&#8217;pose
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
I&#8217;d ever have got my quilt done in time for the State
fair? Fifty-five thousand five hundred and fifty
pieces there&#8217;s in it, and I&#8217;ve willed it to Jessica Trent
when I&#8217;m done exhibitin&#8217; it. None of &#8217;em bigger &#8217;n
a finger nail, and all done over paper. That&#8217;s a piece of
work, I &#8217;low. What&#8217;s your complaint?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I don&#8217;t know as I have any. They&#8217;ve made me
very comfortable and welcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dare say. They couldn&#8217;t do otherwise. Giddap
there, Balaam. Rosetty smells alfalfa, and you&#8217;ll have
to step out to keep up with a cow &#8217;at does that. I
mean what&#8217;s your disease?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! well&#8211;it&#8217;s of no consequence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Man alive, don&#8217;t neglect yourself. You&#8217;re yallar.
You&#8217;ve got the janders. Sure&#8217;s I&#8217;m a living woman
that&#8217;s what it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not. I hope not,&#8221; said the poor man, but
rather feebly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure. Or shingles. I&#8217;ve never seen a real likely
case of shingles, and if it <i>should</i> be that, I&#8217;d just admire
to nurse you. What victuals you been eating?&#8221;</p>

<p>The dyspeptic winced. This sounded truly professional,
for all his numerous physicians had prefaced
their treatment by a similar question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been able to eat almost anything and everything
since I came into this country of open-air living. The
last thing was some of Elsa Winkler&#8217;s swiebach and
honey-sweetened coffee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say! Oh! oh! Poison, sir, rank poison.
You may as well count yourself dead and laid out<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>The unfortunate stranger shivered and turned pale.
For some half hour past, he had been suffering various
qualms which he had attributed to Elsa&#8217;s hospitality,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
but to tell a nervous invalid that he has been poisoned
is to increase his misery a hundredfold. If Aunt Sally
had desired a patient she was now in a fair way to secure
one; but her words were without any significance
to herself beyond the fact that she favored neither
Elsa nor her cookery. Elsa&#8217;s knitting work had
crowded her own patchwork pretty closely at that famous
fair, and the handsome money prize, which she
felt belonged of rights to herself, had been halved between
the pair. Because, though their skill lay along
different lines, they had both signed their exhibits:
&#8220;From Sobrante,&#8221; and, manifestly, the judges could
not give two first premiums to one estate.</p>

<p>This memory served to change her thoughts from
disease to a detailed history of the wonderful quilt,
during which they arrived at Mrs. Trent&#8217;s cottage and
dinner.</p>

<p>But this could not yet be served. Aunt Sally must
needs first see her son, and after the fondest of greetings,
cautiously consign to him the care of her personal
outfit. She even ran after him&#8211;as he walked away,
grinning and leading the now obstreperous cow&#8211;with
a vial in her hand, begging:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now son, please me, before you eat that &#8216;mess&#8217; of
men&#8217;s cooking by taking one spoonful of this dandelion
relish. Made it myself, purposely for you, and I&#8217;ll
warrant no alcohol in it, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>Experience had proved that protestation was worse
than useless; so, with another grin, but a really affectionate
&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; John accepted the vial and once
more started stableward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Aunt Sally, come! You must be hungry yourself,
after your long ride,&#8221; urged Mrs. Trent, hospitably,
and with sincere pleasure lighting her gentle face.
Living so far from other women made the presence of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
even this uncouth one a comfort, and experience had
proved that Mrs. Benton was, in time of need, that
&#8220;rough diamond&#8221; which she claimed herself to be.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, honey; in a minute. I&#8217;ll just step out to
the kitchen and pass the time of day with Wun Lung.
Besides<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica caught Aunt Sally around her waist&#8211;as far
as she could reach&#8211;and tried to prevent her leaving
the room, but was lightly set aside, with the remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Face is next door to the mouth. Guess I want to
see what sort of food that heathen&#8217;s got ready for us,
&#8217;fore I touch it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Aunt Sally! In my house&#8211;can&#8217;t you trust
me?&#8221; asked the hostess, with mild protest. Though she
knew before she spoke that her will as opposed to Mrs.
Benton&#8217;s, at least in minor matters, was powerless. So
she quietly brought a book and offered it to Mr. Hale,
with the suggestion that he make himself content for
the present.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dinner will be delayed and there will be a rumpus
in the kitchen. But the dinner will be all the better
for waiting and the rumpus will end in Wun Lung
taking another rest while Aunt Sally does his work.
Fortunately, she is a prime cook, and we shall fare
sumptuously every day. I&#8217;d be glad to keep her here,
always, if I could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Ephraim Marsh did not appear to share your
sentiments,&#8221; and he described &#8220;Forty-niner&#8217;s&#8221; behavior
and remarks at first sighting Mrs. Benton&#8217;s wagon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you found him. He&#8217;s come back with you?
Oh! I am so thankful. Sobrante wouldn&#8217;t seem itself
without that straightforward, honest old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are certain he is that?&#8221; asked, rather than asserted,
the other.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>&#8220;As certain as that there is honesty anywhere. What
can you mean? Why do you seem so doubtful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish to be a talebearer, but another of your
adoring <i>proteges</i> is in dire trouble. Elsa has been
robbed and accuses this unfortunate person of being the
culprit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a thing would be impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it seemed to me. Yet that old Wolfgang finally
got it through his head&#8211;he appeared duller of wit
than his wife&#8211;that to lose sight of Ephraim was to
lose the money forever. Your little daughter promised
to produce him when needed, and after considerable
opposition they allowed him to come away. I fancy
they began to suspect me even. I fear, madam, I have
visited Sobrante at an unfortunate time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent was paying but slight attention to his
words. Her mind was already disturbed by many inexplicable
things and would revert to Antonio&#8217;s insinuations
which, without Jessica&#8217;s knowledge, she had
also overheard. After a moment, recalled by high
voices in the kitchen, she rallied, and apologizing for
so doing, hastily left the dining-porch.</p>

<p>There were several gleaming pots and pans upon the
oil cooking-stove and behind these stood Wun Lung,
tenaciously grasping a meat dish and glaring unutterable
things out of his beady eyes upon the excited
woman who faced him, demanding:</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me that platter, monkey-face! Suppose I&#8217;ll
put your dirty victuals into my clean mouth or anybody
else&#8217;s? I&#8217;ve tasted your stuff before. A burnt
bairn dreads the fire. Hand it over. I&#8217;ll see if it&#8217;s fit.
There! That rice is boiling over.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dish of savory lamb stew had been most daintily
and carefully prepared after his mistress&#8217; own minute
directions, but Wun Lung now slammed it upon the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
table with much violence and seized the pipkin of rice
from the stove. With undue emphasis he placed this
beside the stew and, advancing toward Mrs. Trent,
made several profound salaams.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lat m&#8217;loman come&#8211;me glo. Good-by.&#8221;</p>

<p>And for many a day thereafter Wun Lung served
no more in that, his own beloved kitchen.</p>

<p>Not a whit disturbed was Aunt Sally. Revolution
had become as the breath in her nostrils. Wherever she
went old orders were reversed and all things became
new. At a little town, with an unpronounceable Spanish
name, which it suited her to call &#8220;Boston,&#8221; she had
her home-room in the house of a long-suffering woman
cousin, whose ill-health afforded her infinite employment,
therefore enjoyment. The invalid endured
these ministrations because Aunt Sally also supported
her, as well as ruled her; but she appreciated the rest
which followed whenever the itching of Mrs. Benton&#8217;s
feet called their owner elsewhere. Between &#8220;Boston&#8221;
and Sobrante the patriotic wagon vibrated, like a long-distance
pendulum, and departing from either point
carried everything belonging to its proprietor within it.
&#8220;Boston&#8221; having become wearisome it was now Sobrante&#8217;s
turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t been so happy since I first trod shoe
leather. Now, honey, you&#8217;ll have good, clean fixings,
with no opium nor rat tails in &#8217;em,&#8221; she gleefully announced,
returning to the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Sally, hush! What an opinion you&#8217;ll give our
guest of my housekeeping!&#8221; laughed Mrs. Trent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh, child! Anybody that looks at you&#8217;ll know
you hate dirt. Now, eat, all. Only&#8211;you, Mr. Hale, I
must insist you take a dose of this saffron tea. I
steeped it while I was having that set-to with the
Chinaman, for I thank my stars I can always do two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span>
things at once. And if I know the signs&#8211;Gabriella
Trent, if that man hasn&#8217;t got the janders or shingles, or
malary fever, don&#8217;t you tell me a thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly shall not tell you any such thing as that,
dear soul. The trouble is, Mr. Hale, Aunt Sally
is never so happy as when she has a sick person to
nurse. If nobody is ill she does her utmost to make
somebody so, with her uncalled for doses and stews.
But&#8211;once be ill! Ah! dear Aunt Sally, I know how
tender is your touch and how faithful your watch. God
bless you!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not often was the gentle mistress moved to such
emotion, and Mrs. Benton now put on her spectacles
and regarded her hostess over them with a critical air.</p>

<p>&#8220;Land, honey! You must be coming down with
something yourself! I never heard that janders was
catching, but, heart of grace, it might be! Yes, in-deedy,
it might be!&#8221;</p>

<p>The delight of her tone was equaled only by the
sparkle of her eye. To have come to Sobrante, guided
merely by the itching of a foot and to find two patients
ready to hand, what mortal could ask more?</p>

<p>Possibly, with the intention of helping on their timely
disorders, she heaped her neighbors&#8217; plates with the
savory dinner, which was wholly due to Wun Lung&#8217;s
skill, and not, as she fancied, to her brief supervision.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, Aunt Sally retreated to the
kitchen, after forcing Mrs. Trent to lie down and rest,
&#8220;whether or no;&#8221; and to aid the lady&#8217;s slumbers, there
presently arose from without the lusty cries of two
small lads who had returned from some prank, late as
usual, and as usual, desperately hungry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will have my dinner, so there, you old Aunt Sally!
I will go tell my mother&#8211;I won&#8217;t be spanked&#8211;I won&#8217;t
I&#8211;I&#8211;I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>&#8220;Wonbepanked!&#8221; screamed another childish treble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you will, the brace of you. Spare the rod and
spoil the child. That&#8217;s what Gabriella does, all the
time, soft-hearted dear that she is. A good, sound
spanking once in six months is all that keeps you in
a state of salvation. If it wasn&#8217;t for me I don&#8217;t know
what in reason you little tackers would grow up to be.
One thing I do know, though, and so do you, and that
is&#8211;that while your old Aunt Sally is at Sobrante ranch
you&#8217;ll never be late to your victuals again.&#8221;</p>

<p>In this events proved that the speaker was right, as,
indeed, she had often been before on similar occasions.</p>

<p>Knowing that this little family jar would result in
no serious harm to her idolized son, Mrs. Trent lay
still and thought, but did not sleep. How could she?
What a subtle thing is suggestion!</p>

<p>Poor, overburdened Gabriella Trent had known and
trusted old Epbraim Marsh for many years; yet the
words of Antonio, and now of this stranger within her
gates, lingered in her memory and would not then leave.</p>

<p>Up in his pleasant guest chamber Mr. Hale felt within
himself the increasing vigor of returning health,
tempered for the moment, it may be, by a little indiscretion
of diet; yet the assertion of that noisy old woman
below stairs, that he was, despite all, on the verge
of some serious illness, so worked upon his still weakened
nerves that he could neither sleep nor forget them.</p>

<p>The result in both cases was unfortunate.</p>

<p>That evening Mrs. Trent forbade her daughter the
rifle practice for which, promply on his return, Ephraim
had made special preparation. Her refusal hurt
the old fellow, already sensitive from a previous injury,
and he reflected, bitterly, as he once more sought his
monkish chamber:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>&#8220;After all, whoever dismissed me was right. I&#8217;m too
old for use. I&#8217;d better never have come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>As for Mr. Hale, brooding and an unwise exposure
to the night air on the previous evening, did bring on a
slight fever. Worriment increased this and, like many
men, he was impatient under suffering; so that when
his bell rang sharply, demanding attention, he was in a
fair way to require all that Aunt Sally or any other had
to give.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, down at the adobe quarters, other suspicions
were rife.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that man doing here, any way? He don&#8217;t
tell his business, and he&#8217;s asked a power of questions.
He&#8217;s wormed out of one and another of us all there
is to learn about this ranch, and he hasn&#8217;t let on a
single thing about himself, except that he&#8217;s a lawyer
from New York. New York&#8217;s a big village and all
lawyers can lie. I&#8217;m bound to sound that chap before
I&#8217;m many hours older,&#8221; said Joe Dean, bringing his
hands down heavily upon the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know a trick worth two of that. Set mother on
him!&#8221; cried John Benton, gayly. &#8220;She&#8217;ll ask more
questions to the square inch than any other human being
I ever met, and she&#8217;ll have all his business, family
history, and present undertakings out of him before he
can say Jack Robinson. Lucky for us she got that
itching foot just when she did.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was agreed; and thus, primed to the fullest
investigation, Aunt Sally and her curiosity established
themselves within their victim&#8217;s sickroom. When they
emerged from it, at daybreak, the one had been fully
satisfied&#8211;with horror; and the ruddy face of the
other had grown white and heartbroken as no single
night of watching should have left it.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE GUEST DEPARTS</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Well, mother! What are you doing, waking me out
of my beauty sleep, this way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak to me, John Benton. This is no time
for fooling. Not till I&#8217;ve got my breath, knocked out
of me by the plumb wickedness of this world. That I
should have lived to hear such things and not died in
my tracks!&#8221;</p>

<p>Upon leaving Mr. Hale&#8217;s sickroom, Aunt Sally had
traveled as fast as her nimble feet could carry her to
her son&#8217;s quarters, in the old mission, and had burst
in upon his slumbers, with a mighty groan.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to be, for one thing. There, lie still. I
can talk and you can listen&#8211;and you&#8217;ll need support
&#8217;fore I&#8217;m through. That man! Oh! that man!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m. Which one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up. You need spankin&#8217; as bad as ever you
did. But&#8211;John, John! The vilest wretch that ever
trod shoe leather! The best, the generousest, the noblest&#8211;and
not here to say a word for his poor self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, your remarks seem a little mixed. If you&#8217;ll
face the other way I&#8217;ll have on my clothes in a jiffy.
Can&#8217;t &#8217;pear to sense things so well, lying a-bed after
daylight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton stepped outside the house and paced the
beaten path with a tread powerful enough to crush all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
her enemies, had they been in her way. Swiftly,
heavily, back and forth, with clinched hands and grim
lips, the woman was rather working her indignation to
a higher point than allaying it, and as the carpenter
limped from his quarters he saw this, and thought:</p>

<p>&#8220;She meant it. No time for fooling when she&#8217;s
stirred up that way. What in the name of reason can
ail her?&#8221;</p>

<p>After a plunge of his head in the water of the general
washing-trough, through which a fresh stream was
continually piped, and a drying on the roller towel suspended
near it, his wits were clearer. Finishing his
toilet by means of his pocket-comb, he considered himself
ready for her story and for anything that it might
entail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Sally paused and glared at him in such a vicious
manner that he felt as if he were again that little boy
of hers who needed the usual corporal punishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but mother&#8211;what have <i>I</i> done?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Done? Nothing! Not a man jack of you! Let
that viper warm himself at her very fireside, least to
say, south porch, and not show him up for what he was.
Land! The men! I never saw one yet was worth
shucks, savin&#8217; hers and mine. If you was half the fellow
your father was, John Benton, or that noble
Cass&#8217;us was&#8211;oh! if ever <i>I</i> wanted to be a man in my
life I want to be this minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>The carpenter darted into his chamber and reappeared
with a vial and spoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;To please me, mother, &#8217;fore you say any more, just
take a spoonful of this dandelion relish. Made it myself,
you know, and warrant no alcohol in it!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>The jester was rewarded by a boxed ear, but he had
effectually arrested his parent&#8217;s wandering thoughts,
and she burst forth with her news:</p>

<p>&#8220;That viper-lawyer-man has come to this Sobrante
to accuse Cass&#8217;us Trent of stealing! lyin! cheating!
Cass&#8217;us, your best friend and mine. Says there&#8217;s a
power of money missing, that was all consigned to
him, to purchase that Paraiso d&#8217;Oro for a community
and never reported on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? W-h-a-t!&#8221;</p>

<p>John had laid his hand upon her shoulder like a vise,
and she began to whimper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Needn&#8217;t pinch me, child. &#8217;Twasn&#8217;t I said it. You
told me to find out what he wanted here and I have.
He pretends he lost his way, got off the road he was
showed to take and met Lady Jess in the canyon. Says
his own horse is up to Pedro&#8217;s sheep pasture. Says<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>And you let him?</i> Had him right there in your
power and didn&#8217;t knock his old teeth down his lying
throat?&#8221;</p>

<p>As John&#8217;s wrath increased his mother&#8217;s ebbed. She
had passed her indignation on to another, as it were,
and felt the relief of this confidence.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t. I left that for you to do. They was
false ones any way and wouldn&#8217;t have hurt none. Hold
on! Where you going, son?&#8221;</p>

<p>For the carpenter had started forward, as if intent
upon instant and terrible vengeance. Neither of them
noticed that Jessica had followed Aunt Sally hither till
a girl&#8217;s voice implored:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! That would let my mother know and it
would kill her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain! You here? You understand?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>&#8220;Yes&#8211;yes. They waked me, talking, and I crept to
the upper hall to stop them, so they should not disturb
my poor, tired dear. Oh! I heard! I heard&#8211;every&#8211;single&#8211;dreadful
word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to fix him for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;John, wait&#8211;wait. I must think. My precious
mother<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica rarely wept. Now she flung herself into
Aunt Sally&#8217;s arms and sobbed in a way that set the
carpenter raging afresh. One after another the &#8220;boys&#8221;
came out from the closed or open doors along the row.
Some because it was their usual hour for rising, others
to learn the cause of these early voices. But one glimpse
of Lady Jess in trouble grouped every ranchman about
her and set each to hurling a torrent of questions upon
that good woman, who held her, without pause for any
answer.</p>

<p>But John held up his hand and told the story. It
belonged to them all, as Jessica did, and the honor of
Sobrante.</p>

<p>They heard it with little comment, save groans and
occasional mutterings, punctuated by fresh inquiries
of Mrs. Benton. Considerable mystery had been thrown
about her cross-examination of her temporary patient,
and after all it had proved the simplest matter in the
world. Concerning his own personal affairs he was
provokingly silent, but he was as ready to talk about
his business in that region as she was to have him when,
after a roundabout preparation, she brought him to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am in honor pledged to do my best for my employers
in the East, and unwilling to remain here under
false colors, so to speak, any longer. Who is the most
responsible person here, excepting Mrs. Trent?&#8221; had
been his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am,&#8221; promptly replied Aunt Sally.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span>&#8220;Then you shall hear my story,&#8221; and he told it.</p>

<p>The effect of it was to loose her tongue to its utmost.
One may guess the listener heard himself portrayed in
colors he failed to recognize and that he realized he had
made a mistake in the selection of a <i>confidante</i>. However,
his purpose had been to do away with all doubt
concerning himself, and to do this with as little distress
to his hostess as possible. For that reason he had believed
a woman would be his best aid, but it proved that
almost any ranchman on the place would have been
safer than she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I ought to have known that a female who talks
so much must say something amiss, and I can&#8217;t blame
her for her indignation. In her stead I might have behaved
worse; and the thing now is to get over this
little weakness and go away about the miserable business,
at once,&#8221; he reflected. Then he watched her hurry
out of his room and surmised whither she would turn
her steps. Therefore, he was not surprised when, somewhat
later, he also left the cottage to find himself confronted
by great Samson, quietly, but significantly,
awaiting the stranger&#8217;s appearance. For the great
fellow had naturally been appointed by his mates to
&#8220;settle that critter&#8217;s hash and settle it sudden.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Samson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems so wonderful to me to wake and find this
changeless sunshine, day after day, as if no such things
as storms could ever exist,&#8221; said the lawyer, pleasantly.</p>

<p>Samson&#8217;s grimness relaxed to a slight degree. &#8220;Some
kind of storms blow in fair weather. Likely you&#8217;ll
meet up with one sooner&#8217;n you expect. Step this way,
will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sailor&#8217;s expression was so formidable that, for a
moment, all the wild tales the lawyer had ever read of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
western desperadoes returned to test his already weakened
nerves. But he was no coward, and knew that
though in a most uncomfortable position, it was by no
means a guilty one.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Samson led the way, if walking closely beside the
guest, as a constable walks beside his prisoner, may be
termed leading. Nor once did he turn his angry gaze
from the gentleman&#8217;s face, and the riding-crop in his
hand swung to and fro, as if longing to test itself
against some enemy&#8217;s body. The walk ended in the
ranchmen&#8217;s messroom, where Wun Lung, released from
the cottage kitchen, had already been impressed into
service, and was deftly preparing breakfast. Aunt
Sally had disappeared, but Jessica was there, perched
on a corner of the dresser, by which stood &#8220;Forty-niner,&#8221;
with his arm about her. All the other workmen
whom Mr. Hale had seen were also present and an air
of silent fury pervaded the whole assemblage.</p>

<p>The stranger&#8217;s glance passed swiftly from one face
to another and saw no kindness on any. Even the little
captain&#8217;s eyes were bent downward and her lovely face
wore a sorrow it made his own heart ache to see.</p>

<p>Joe Dean lounged forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stranger, have you broke your fast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another silence, during which the blacksmith poured
a cup of inky coffee from the great pot, hacked off a
piece of bread from a dusky loaf, and shoved them
toward their unwelcome guest across the table by which
he had sat down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eat, and be quick about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The color rose in the Easterner&#8217;s cheek, but he made
no motion to obey, and after a brief waiting, seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
this, Joe threw the coffee out of the window and tossed
the bread to the dogs.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a horse outside. It&#8217;s for you. The poorest
we&#8217;ve got, because once you&#8217;ve bestrode him no decent
man&#8217;ll ever mount him again. He&#8217;ll answer, though,
to carry you beyond this valley, and Samson&#8217;ll go with
you to see you leave it for good. Then he&#8217;ll turn the
beast loose and may the Lord have mercy on your dirty
soul. <i>Get!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale did not stir. His own eye gathered fire
and the pink in his face grew scarlet, but his voice was
calm as he inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I still at Sobrante, the home of gentlefolks? By
whose orders, please, this present dramatic scene?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; this is Sobrante. The home of gentlefolks&#8211;you
spoke the truth for once. The home of Cassius
Trent, the truest man, the noblest heart, the whitest
gentleman the good Lord ever made. The home of a
man! and not a free hotel for whelps! Ugh! If I had
promised the captain&#8211;Lady Jess, let me off that word!
I must at him, I <i>must</i>&#8211;<i>I will!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>Joe&#8217;s attitude was full of menace, but Mr. Hale
neither moved nor took his own cool gaze from his
enemy&#8217;s face. Though Jessica had taken swift alarm
and leaped down to place herself beside the smith and
clasp his hand with her own.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. You promised, and I&#8217;m your captain. Soldiers
obey their captains and you chose me yourself.
You are not to hurt him nor abuse him, though, I, too&#8221;&#8211;here she wheeled about and faced her guest, crying:
&#8220;hate you, hate you! Oh! that&#8217;s wicked. That&#8217;s rude.
But, sir, how dared you say my father&#8211;the best man
ever lived&#8211;kept&#8211;took&#8211;it isn&#8217;t true, it isn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>The lawyer rose, somewhat unsteadily. The sight of
the daughter&#8217;s grief disturbed his calmness more than
the affronts offered him by her bearded henchmen. It
was to her that he addressed the question:</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I permitted to say a word in my own behalf,
Captain Jessica?&#8221;</p>

<p>A growl ran around the room, but she held up her
small hand, protestingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s fair. My father always taught me to
be fair. I&#8217;m sorry I was&#8211;I wasn&#8217;t polite<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you aren&#8217;t,&#8221; shouted Samson. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare
be sorry for anything but the kindness you&#8217;ve showed
that skunk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Samson, it was you made me captain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I give in. Be as fair as you like, I can&#8217;t
help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us all there is to tell. As you told Aunt Sally.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, captain. I&#8217;ll be brief. I came to California,
representing a company, a syndicate, which had
advanced large sums of money to purchase, improve,
and stock a vast tract of land called Paraiso d&#8217;Oro.
Though for a time due receipts and reports had been
returned to the syndicate for several months these had
entirely ceased. Unfortunately, the company had implicit
faith in their consignee, and Paraiso d&#8217;Oro was
but one of their many enterprises. I had been their
legal adviser in other matters, and when my health
failed from overwork, they suggested that I should
come here and investigate their affairs, while I could
recuperate at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;I set out on horseback from Los Angeles, my temporary
headquarters, without a guide and with many
erroneous notions concerning both the State and its
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
people. You see, though I&#8217;d lived at the center of our
national civilization<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re forgettin&#8217; Californy!&#8221; cried somebody.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d led the narrow life of a man absorbed in one
sort of business. I traveled out of my way, and lost it.
Then I met your captain in the canyon and she courteously
offered me the hospitality of Sobrante. Until
I reached this spot I had no idea that it was part and
parcel, so to speak, of that Paraiso I&#8217;d come to reclaim.
Gradually this fact became clear to me and from that
moment I have been anxious to get away from a hospitality
I have no moral right to enjoy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Spoke the truth for once, liar!&#8221; grumbled Cromarty.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot feel it more than I, sir, nor more profoundly
regret that it is my misfortune to have undertaken
a business which has now become obnoxious to
me. But a lawyer must look at facts. One Cassius
Trent<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Take care!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Be quiet, Marty! Go on, Mr. Hale,&#8221; ordered the
little captain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cassius Trent was the man whose hitherto probity
and enthusiasm had enlisted the interest of his New
York friends. He represented that his projected community
would not only be an excellent investment for
their money, but a benefaction to humanity. They believed
him and&#8211;well, their money is gone, their community
has not even a beginning, and the man is dead.
He seems to have been a person<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A white gentleman, sir!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who could obtain a strong hold upon the affections
and confidence of all who knew him. I admire the
qualities which gained your devotion and I admire your
loyalty to him. I am charmed with the home he created
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
in this wilderness&#8211;<i>for himself</i>&#8211;and I have the profoundest
respect for his afflicted family. I wish I had
not undertaken this trust. But I have so undertaken,
I am sworn to my clients&#8217; interests, and I must further
them to my utmost ability. If the missing money can
be recovered I shall recover it, painful as my duty may
be. And&#8211;that is all. Good-by, little captain. It is
my sincere wish that I may find some explanation of
this mystery, other than circumstantial evidence seems
to point. If I so find I shall return and tell you. If
not&#8211;good-by. Make my respectful regards to your
mother, and thank you for my entertainment.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned and walked to the doorway, nobody interfering;
but there he paused and asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;That horse you mentioned? Can I purchase him of
you? If so I need not trouble Samson for his escort,
but will bid you, gentlemen, good-morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>A significant look ran around the circle of intent and
lowering faces. The lawyer&#8217;s succinct explanation of
affairs had impressed them, but it had not altered one
fact which most mattered to those hardy countrymen.</p>

<p>A dead man, their idolized master and friend, had
been accused of black dishonesty, and they had passed
their own promise to their girlish captain not to injure
the accuser.</p>

<p>But they had not promised he should go scot-free.
To some men shame was worse than a bullet wound.
It would have been so to them, and they did the
stranger thus much honor that they ascribed him equal
manliness.</p>

<p>As he stepped across the threshold Mr. Hale found
both Samson and John Benton close beside him, at
right hand and left; and when he was about to mount
the superannuated beast, which a grinning stable lad
held for him, he was pinioned and quietly hoisted into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
the saddle. Instantly, a brace of straps secured him
and Samson&#8217;s crop cut viciously at the animal&#8217;s neck.
Then the sailor sprang into his own saddle and, amid
the insulting shouts and jeers of the assembled ranchmen,
the unfortunate Easterner rode out of the mission
courtyard&#8211;face backward.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A PROJECTED JOURNEY</span></h2>

<p>Captain Jess screamed and ran forward, but her outstretched
hands could not reach her guest, already
borne many rods away. Then she faced the jeering
men, with an anger she had not believed it possible that she
could ever feel toward her beloved &#8220;boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shame on you! Shame on you, every one! How
dared you? And I thought&#8211;I thought&#8211;you were
gentlemen!&#8221;</p>

<p>With arms tightly folded over her breast, as if to
hold back the conflicting emotions within it, her blue
eyes flashing, her small foot stamping, she defied and
condemned them all.</p>

<p>A little laughter answered her, but this sound died
speedily, and awkward glances shifted among the faces
of the men. They were sorry to have offended the
&#8220;Little One,&#8221; and to have her indignant with them was
a new and unpleasant situation, but they were not in the
least degree sorry that they had administered some
punishment to the maligner of their master. Most of
them would have wished this punishment more severe,
but the promise Jessica had exacted from them before
this interview had prevented.</p>

<p>One by one, as they had first come upon the scene
they retreated from it, though Joe Dean lingered a
moment to ask:</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come share our breakfast, captain, and
so bury the hatchet?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span>She sadly shook her head. All her anger left her as
suddenly as it had arisen, and there remained in her
mind but one thought&#8211;there were people in the world
who believed her father had been a thief. That was
the hard and bitter fact which nothing could soften.
The former trouble about the lost title deed, and the
probable loss of her home seemed as nothing to this
new distress. How was she to face it? How disprove
it? How save her beloved mother from ever hearing
it?</p>

<p>There came a step beside her and a strong arm about
her shoulders. It was Ephraim Marsh; erect, resolute,
protecting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take it easy, daughter. It&#8217;s you and me together&#8217;ll
nail this lie on the door of the man who started it.
There&#8217;s a blue sky up yonder and a solid earth down
here. I&#8217;m good to trust the one and tread the other
for forty miles a day yet, spite of my white head. If
I have to travel this old State over its hundred and
fifty-six thousand square miles, before I clinch that
falsehood, I&#8217;ll clinch it, if I live. If I don&#8217;t&#8211;laws,
dearie, I&#8217;m in the same poor box myself. There&#8217;s them
that believe me a&#8211;you know the word. Even your
mother<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Ephraim! She never believed you anything
but the splendid man you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night, no shooting, and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was nothing. She was tired. Aunt Sally always
tires her, at first, good as she is and much as we love
her. Mother is so quiet and gentle herself<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand, darlin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim, she must never know that dreadful thing
the stranger said.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain, she&#8217;ll have to know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>&#8220;She must not, I tell you! What am I for but to take
care of and love her? Ned&#8211;but Ned&#8217;s only a little
boy<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you, my Jessie, are but a few years older than
he.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m older than you, I believe! Is it only two days
since I met that man in the canyon and things began to
happen? It seems forever. As if I&#8217;d only lived these
forty-eight hours, and all that went before was a
dream.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim stepped aside and regarded her shrewdly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old words to come from so young a mouth, Lady
Captain. Have you had any breakfast?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I don&#8217;t want any. Have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. But I&#8217;m going to have. As a rule, breakfasts
are wholesome. Keeping your stomach quiet keeps
your head clear. Things&#8217;ll look more natural after
we&#8217;ve eat. Share mine?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I mustn&#8217;t. Mother would miss me and wonder.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You often do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s better you share mine to-day. Then we must
plan. I heard you say that about you and me together.
Will you help me? Shall we prove it wasn&#8217;t true&#8211;to
the rest of the world, I mean&#8211;as we know it? Shall
we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the rest of my life-job, darlin&#8217;. We&#8217;ll begin
it right away by getting a taste of Aunt Sally&#8217;s good
victuals. I hate her picra doses, but her cooking beats
the Dutch.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afterward?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afterward isn&#8217;t touched yet.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>Whether real or affected there had come a cheerfulness
into the old man&#8217;s tone which it had lacked a few
moments earlier. After all he was not useless. Who
knew his California as he did? If it were true that
money had been sent to Mr. Trent&#8217;s hands and was
missing, then somewhere was a man who had appropriated
it. Whoever and wherever he was, he should
be found, and Ephraim Marsh was self-appointed so
to find.</p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s hand slipped under his arm, and her own
face grew somewhat lighter as she walked beside him
toward her own home, where Aunt Sally was keeping
an anxious lookout and a most tempting breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless you, Jessie! I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve come. Step
right in, Ephy. Them muffins are so light they&#8217;ve nigh
flown off the porch. Made with the eggs my hen-chicken
laid, comin&#8217; along from Boston. Smartest fowl in the
country, and only one I ever owned would brood and
lay at the same time. I wouldn&#8217;t take a fortune for
that bird.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aunt Sally&#8217;s own cheerfulness was fully restored.
With her to be busy helping somebody was, after all,
her happiness. And she saw that she had never come
to Sobrante more opportunely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother isn&#8217;t up yet, dearie. And I&#8217;ve had the
tackers out and washed &#8217;em good. Then I filled them
with hot milk, and some of my salt-risin&#8217; bread I
fetched along in my box, and put &#8217;em to bed. I promised
if they&#8217;d go to sleep again I&#8217;d make &#8217;em each a
saucer-pie, and they went.&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of her heavy heart, Jessica laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Sally, I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;s another person
could make them go to sleep at this time of day; not
even my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>&#8220;Pooh! Her! Why, that little Edward knows he
can twist her round his thumb easy as scat. He&#8217;s too
much the look of his father for Gabriella ever to be sot
with him. You, now, you favor her folks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here, foreseeing that the talkative woman was off on
a long track, Ephraim mildly inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Sally, did you bring that rheumatism-oil you
had last time you were here?&#8221;</p>

<p>She put on her spectacles and looked at him over
them, as was her habit. Never, by any chance, had she
been known to look through them, and her explanation
of wearing them at all was simply: &#8220;It&#8217;s proper for a
woman of my age.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephy, you feel real bright, don&#8217;t you? You and
rheumatism! Why, man, you&#8217;ll be getting married
before you get rheumatic.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll never need the oil.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was not to be so easily worsted. If Ephraim was
minded to be facetious, she&#8217;d match him at the business.
Whereupon, instead of rehearsing the history
of Gabriella&#8217;s &#8220;folks&#8221; she veered round upon disease
and gave them details of all the dreadful things she had
ever heard till &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; cried, &#8220;Quits! I&#8217;ll not
tackle you again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Benton&#8217;s eyes twinkled over her cup, for she
had joined them at table. She knew, as he did, that this
was but foolish sport, yet that it had served their
mutual purpose; which was to divert Jessica&#8217;s thoughts
from trouble and her lips from asking why her mother
did not appear.</p>

<p>But the meal over, the question came, and the answer
was ready:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I just coaxed her to lie and rest a spell. She
knew that I&#8217;d look after things all right, and can make
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
butter next grade to hers, if I can&#8217;t equal. Anybody
that&#8217;s been worrying with a Chinaman as long as she
has needs a vacation, I &#8217;low. So she&#8217;s taking a mite of
one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll gather a bunch of roses and take to her.
I&#8217;m glad to have her rest, and I hope&#8211;Aunt Sally, do
you suppose she heard any of that dreadful man&#8217;s talk?
Did you tell her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I didn&#8217;t tell her. I&#8217;d sooner never say another
word as long as I live than do such a thing. You
needn&#8217;t be afraid to trust your old auntie, child. There,
run along and make her a posy.&#8221;</p>

<p>But no sooner had Jessica gone into the garden than
Aunt Sally&#8217;s lips were close to Ephraim&#8217;s ear, and she
was whispering:</p>

<p>&#8220;She heard it, every word. She didn&#8217;t say so, and I
didn&#8217;t ask. But the look of it in her eyes. Ephraim
Marsh, I&#8217;ve got a heartbroken woman on my hands,
and don&#8217;t you dare to tell me a word &#8217;at I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that tongue of yours! Last night when you
were yelling at him why didn&#8217;t you think about other
folks&#8217; hearts and be still? You&#8217;ve a voice like a fog
horn when you&#8217;re mad&#8211;or pleased, either!&#8221; cried this
honest, ungallant frontiersman.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, Ephy. It&#8217;s the truth. I realize it as well
as you do. And I was mad. Since she heard, anyway,
I wish now &#8217;at I&#8217;d up and thrashed him good. I had
laid out to put a little bitter dose in his coffee this
morning, but he went away without taking any,&#8221; she
ended, grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sally Benton, you&#8217;re quite contriving. What&#8217;s to be
done?&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she could reply Jessica came back, her arms
full of great rose-branches and her face bright with
confidence.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>&#8220;Ephraim, Aunt Sally, I&#8217;ve thought of something.
It came to me out there among the roses, like a voice
speaking; my mother must not and need not be told
what Mr. Hale said. It isn&#8217;t wicked to deceive her in
this, for her own good. Often you&#8217;ve asked her to let
you take me horseback trip to Los Angeles, stopping
nights at houses on the way, with people who knew my
father; and she&#8217;s promised I should &#8216;some time.&#8217; I
think the &#8216;some time&#8217; has come. She will be glad to
have us go, for one thing, to find out about the feather
markets and others that Antonio used to take care of,
but has left. Aunt Sally does two things at once; why
not we? We&#8217;ll hunt that man who took the money;
and if I can&#8217;t find the deed first&#8211;though, of course, I
shall&#8211;we&#8217;ll straighten that out, too. Isn&#8217;t that good
sense?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more; it&#8217;s inspiration,&#8221; responded &#8220;Forty-niner,&#8221;
enthusiastically. He had already decided to
make this journey alone, for Jessica&#8217;s sake; but with
her as companion he felt that it would be as sure of
success as full of pleasure. A little child working to
clear her father&#8217;s name of dishonor, and to save her
mother&#8217;s home&#8211;what evil could prevail against this
noble effort?</p>

<p>It was like his simplicity and hers that neither
thought of providing for difficulties by the way, or for
any delay in finding the men and proofs they sought,
when once they reached the distant city.</p>

<p>Aunt Sally was not so sanguine; yet it was not her
part to discourage any attempt to set wrong matters
right, and she merely nodded her head and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll bear thinking on. Now, run along and see your
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has she had her breakfast? Can&#8217;t I carry it to
her?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>&#8220;S&#8217;pose I&#8217;d let that poor lamb go without her dawn-meal
late as this? I heard her stirring the minute I got
back into the house, so I fixed her some broma and
poached her an egg, and made her go lie down again.
You&#8217;ll not find her hungry, child, &#8217;less for a sight of
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica ran to her mother&#8217;s room, exclaiming:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re resting, dear. Were ever more
perfect roses? And isn&#8217;t it delightful that Aunt Sally
should be here just now to look after things. Because<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my darling? Why do you hesitate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother, may Ephraim and I go on that trip to Los
Angeles?&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Jess had intended to be very careful and cautious,
for once, and to test her mother&#8217;s feelings on the
subject she made her request. But frankness was her
habit, and the question was out of itself, it seemed, and
she waiting the answer with a beating heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why just now, daughter? And&#8211;has Mr. Hale
gone?&#8221; she asked, in a peculiar tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He has gone. He left rather&#8211;rather suddenly,
but he sent his regards to you and his thanks.
He said he might come back some time, but&#8211;I don&#8217;t
think he will. He said something to offend the &#8216;boys,&#8217;
and they let him take old Dandy. Samson went with
him to show him the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor little captain, who had never in her short life
had one secret thought from her idolized mother. This
first experience did not come easy to her, and after
one glance into the sad, yet amused, eyes watching her,
she tossed secrecy aside and buried her face on her
mother&#8217;s pillow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>&#8220;Mother, mother! I am so unhappy. I&#8217;m keeping
something back from you that I cannot tell you; that
I cannot have you know, and I don&#8217;t like it. But&#8211;it&#8217;s
right, it&#8217;s best. So don&#8217;t ask me, and, oh, mother&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no need to ask you, sweetheart. I know, already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Know&#8211;what?&#8221; cried Jessica alarmed, and sitting
straight again.</p>

<p>&#8220;All that is in your brave heart. All that Mr. Hale
had heard against your father. All that you and Ephraim
hope from this suddenly decided journey to a distant
city.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;how? And I&#8217;d only just thought it out,
yonder in the garden!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had begun to suspect, I hardly know why, that
our late guest had come here as our enemy, or, rather,
as an agent against us. Something held me back from
confiding in him, as I at first wished to do. He is a
gentleman, and doubtless honest, but he is not on our
side. Besides, how and why he went away just as he
did is plain enough. I have ears and I have eyes, and
I heard all Aunt Sally&#8217;s tirade last night, so could easily
guess at his own part in the talk. Also&#8211;I saw him
ride out of the courtyard. My little girl, for the first
time in my life I blushed for Sobrante. Even if he
had been a wicked man, which he was not, that was a
dastardly insult. I am ashamed of your &#8216;boys,&#8217;
captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so am I. And I told them so, quick enough.
Oh! they pretended not to mind my anger, but they
were ashamed&#8211;inside themselves, I know. Now, for
ever so long, they&#8217;ll be so good &#8216;butter would melt
in their mouths.&#8217; You see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Apt pupil of Aunt Sally.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span>&#8220;Why, mother! How can you smile and take it so
quiet? This awful&#8211;awful thing he said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To say a thing is not to prove it. The charge is so
monstrous that it becomes absurd. Nothing hurts us
but what we do, and your father never did a dishonorable
deed, from the hour of his birth till his death. I
am sorry for those mistaken people who think that he
did, and I am thankful that he left a brave little daughter
to set them right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica stared. For a long time past she had seen
her mother anxious and troubled over matters which
now seemed trivial in the extreme; yet this blow which
had almost crushed her own courage but restored Mrs.
Trent&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then do you mean that we may go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother! Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will go armed with the fullest information
we can gain. We will examine all the papers Antonio
left&#8211;if he left any. We will make a thorough search
everywhere for that title deed. We shall probably find
letters from this New York company to your father,
and these will have the name, or names, of those with
whom he did business at Los Angeles. I wish now that
Senor Bernal were here. His knowledge would be
worth everything in this emergency, if&#8211;he would give
it. Well, he is not here, and we must do the best we
can without him. I&#8217;m going to get up now and begin
to look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aunt Sally thought you ought to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This talk will rest me most of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother was now as eager as the child, and together
they were soon engaged in opening Mr. Trent&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
desk and secretary, which his wife had not before
touched since he himself closed them.</p>

<p>Alas! the search was an easy matter, and came
swiftly to an end. Beyond a few personal letters from
relatives and friends, there was not a scrap of writing
anywhere. Even the ledgers and account books had been
removed, and at this discovery the same thought came
to both:</p>

<p>&#8220;Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet, why? and so secretly. He was really the master
here, and if, as he now claims, Sobrante is his, he
has but to prove it, and we will go away,&#8221; said the
widow, trembling for the first time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us try the safe. That night before he went off
in such grief, Ephraim gave me the key. He thought
he was going forever, and I was to look in it some time&#8211;when I needed. We&#8217;ll look now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent herself unlocked the clumsy iron box and
found it empty, save for one small parcel. This,
wrapped in a bit of canvas, was securely tied and addressed
to &#8220;Jessica Trent.&#8221;</p>

<p>The mother passed it to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;You open it, please, mother. It may be&#8211;it must
be&#8211;that deed and maybe some other things&#8211;I couldn&#8217;t
wait to pick the knots, and I&#8217;ve no knife.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE START</span></h2>

<p>Nothing resembling a legal document was found
inside the package; but, instead, were several neatly-arranged
rolls of gold and silver money, with the denomination
of each roll carefully marked outside;
dollars, eagles, double eagles. With these was a scrap
of paper, saying:</p>

<div class='bquote'>
<p>&#8220;All my savings for my captain. God bless them to
her.&#160;&#160;&#160;E.&#160;M.&#8221;</p>
</div> <!-- block quote -->

<p>&#8220;Oh, mother! That big-hearted Ephraim! Was anybody
ever so unselfish as he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or as unjust as I have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How? What can you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent did not answer, save by the tears in her
eyes, though she was tempted to show her child all the
base suspicion that had, for a brief space, dwelt in her
own mind concerning &#8220;Forty-niner.&#8221; A suspicion
which Antonio had suggested, and her trouble made her
too ready to accept. Then she reflected it were wiser
not, and rose, placing the precious parcel in Jessica&#8217;s
own hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us find that splendid old man at once. We cannot
accept his sacrifice, but we must hasten to show
him we appreciate it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim was polishing his rifle in his own room
when they came to him, and rose to welcome the unusual
visit of the lady with more awkwardness than he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
commonly displayed. It was an honor she was doing
him, yet he had far rather she had not come.</p>

<p>But he was forced back into his chair by Jessica&#8217;s assault
of clinging arms and raining kisses, and, catching
sight of the parcel in her hand, began to understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you splendid, darling, generous Ephraim! I
can never, never thank you enough for doing this for
me, but I could not ever possibly take it. Why, there
must be hundreds of dollars there, my mother says,
and that would mean almost all the years you&#8217;ve ever
lived at Sobrante. I never knew anybody with such a
heart as you, dear Ephraim.&#8221;</p>

<p>The poor old fellow was far more distressed by her
rejection of his gift than she could guess. His face
drooped, he worked his hands and feet uneasily, he
shifted his seat, and behaved in altogether a new fashion
for the man who had hitherto borne himself so
simply and naturally. Then the old suspicion returned
to sting his loving heart, and he glanced up to study his
mistress&#8217; face. To his surprise he saw it wet with
tears, and that she was holding out her thin, labor-hardened
hands to clasp his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim Marsh, you have done me more good than
money could bring. You have renewed my faith in mankind.
In a world where live such men as you justice
will be done the memory of my dead husband. I thank
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8211;don&#8217;t mention it, Mrs. Trent. I wish it had
been double, as it ought, only<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim, mother says we may go. You and I, as
you said, &#8216;together,&#8217; to make everything straight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? You&#8217;ve told her then, Lady Jess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Or she guessed. How could I keep anything
from my mother? And she&#8217;s quite willing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m more than willing, Ephraim. I <i>want</i> you to go.
I believe that good will come of the journey, though I
am terribly disappointed by not finding any papers or
letters to help you in the search for the men with whom
Mr. Trent transacted his business. Antonio must have
taken away all the records or put them in some place I
cannot guess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll find Antonio first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. How simple of me not to think of that.
Do you happen to know where he went?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, ma&#8217;am, I don&#8217;t. But you can always track a&#8211;well
some critters by their scent. Wherever that scoundrel
goes he&#8217;ll leave a trail. I&#8217;ve a keen nose for the
hunt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t judge him too harshly, Ephraim. Perhaps he
considered that he was doing all for the best; and if
Sobrante is his, he&#8217;s welcome to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; was the ranchman&#8217;s astonished comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand, dear Ephraim? Losing a
home is nothing to losing honor,&#8221; said Jessica, earnestly.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t care half so much about Sobrante as
that other thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall keep both. Your home and our master&#8217;s
honor,&#8221; cried the old man, fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that we will!&#8221; echoed Jessica, clasping his
hand again.</p>

<p>So doing she dropped the canvas bag on the floor,
and, picking it up, Mrs. Trent would have restored it
to its owner, as she so considered the sharpshooter. But
he would have none of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard the little tackers call one another &#8216;Indian
giver.&#8217; I couldn&#8217;t, ma&#8217;am, you know. It&#8217;s Jessie&#8217;s, now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>The mistress&#8217; face grew serious. She had not expected
to find the man so obstinate. But she hated to
wound him and turned the matter aside with the remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Let it rest so, then, for the present. I will keep it
in the safe till you come back&#8211;if I can. Though I begin
to feel as if nothing were secure at Sobrante, nowadays.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim pondered for a moment, then looked up
with a relieved expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Asking pardon, ma&#8217;am, I&#8217;m sure; have you got any&#8211;I mean much money handy by you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I have not. Fortunately, beyond the wages of
the men, not much ready cash is needed at Sobrante,
where we produce so much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m. Yet I wouldn&#8217;t like to set out on a journey
that might be long, or even delayed for a spell, without
considerable loose change. Better let the captain pay
all expenses of the trip out of that little handful, and
call it square.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Square! That is even greater generosity than the
first. Lying in the safe you might have found it again;
but spent&#8211;Ephraim, I fear I&#8217;ll never be able to repay
such an amount. I must think out some other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you trust me, Mrs. Trent?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I not trusting you with the most precious thing
in life&#8211;my daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, mother, trust him about the money. It&#8217;s good
sense. We haven&#8217;t any and we need it. Besides, it hurts
him to refuse. Yes, we&#8217;ll use it, Ephraim dear.&#8221;</p>

<p>So it was settled; but it was not in Jessica&#8217;s nature
to keep the story from the rest of her &#8220;boys.&#8221; Forgetting
her angry feelings of the morning she called a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
meeting and spread the news among them. Much as she
loved them, until the time of her recent appointment as
&#8220;captain,&#8221; she had tried to give them their titles of
&#8220;Mr.,&#8221; though not always remembering. Now she no
longer tried. They were just her comrades, and when
she stood upon the horseblock to address them it was
with the joyful announcement:</p>

<p>&#8220;John! George! Joe! Everybody! Ephraim and I
are going away!&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused and looked around, but instead of the
sympathetic pleasure she expected there were darkening
looks and evident disappointment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! but we are coming back again. Hark, what
he did!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim was away putting his few traps together
against the morning&#8217;s start, since, if they were to go at
all, why delay? Else he might have silenced her then
and there. But out it came, and be sure the sharpshooter&#8217;s
generosity lost not one bit in her telling.</p>

<p>&#8220;With this money we&#8217;re going to hire lawyers and
pay our lodging where we have to, and hunt up the
men that know about business. Finally, to find the
money&#8211;that other lot of it&#8211;that Mr. Hale said had
been sent to my father by those New York folks. If
they did send it they shall have it back&#8211;if we can find
it. If they didn&#8217;t&#8211;they shall tell all the world they
accused him wrongfully. We&#8217;re going to find the man
that made that title, if we can. We&#8217;re going to save
Sobrante, but we&#8217;re going to save its honor first!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah! Glory to the captain!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And old &#8216;Forty-niner,&#8217;&#8221; added honest John Benton.</p>

<p>They cheered him to the skies, and when the uproar
had subsided, their small chief said:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>&#8220;You are all to take the best care of Sobrante, and
first&#8211;of my mother. Don&#8217;t you let her worry, nor let
Ned and Luis get hurt. And you must keep Aunt Sally
here till I come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Somebody groaned.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! that&#8217;s not right. I couldn&#8217;t go if she hadn&#8217;t
come. She&#8217;ll look after everything<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the true word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I want you all to be&#8211;be good and not tease
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurrah! Hurrah! All in favor of minding the captain,
say Ay!&#8221;</p>

<p>They swung her down from her perch and carried
her on their shoulders everywhere about the old mission.
They offered her all their possessions, including pistols
and bowie knives, at peaceful Sobrante more useful for
target practice and pruning vines than their original
purposes. But she declined all these warlike things,
saying that Ephraim would carry only his own rifle,
and finally tore herself away from them to the anxious
mother at the cottage, naturally jealous of each moment
of her darling&#8217;s company.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t see how Eph. ever saved so much. Hasn&#8217;t
had any wages since ours failed, as I know of. Mine
always go fast as earned, and thought everybody&#8217;s did,&#8221;
said one, when Jessica had left them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some folks have all the luck! Why didn&#8217;t it happen
to me to have money to give her? or to offer first to go
hunt them liars? Shucks!&#8221; said Samson, in disgust.
Though he had been back some time from escorting
the stranger &#8220;off bounds,&#8221; that task had left him in a
bad humor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>&#8220;Well, the captain&#8217;d tell me envy was wicked, and
when I was hearing her say it I&#8217;d believe it. But I do
envy old eighty his chance,&#8221; complained Joe. &#8220;Hello!
there&#8217;s Ferd! Come to think of it I haven&#8217;t noticed
him around these two days. Not since that stranger
cast his ugly shadow on the ranch. Hi, there, Dwarf!
Where you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where I seen bad doings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right. Seeing you was there yourself. What doings
was they?&#8221;</p>

<p>In ordinary the older men had little to say to Antonio&#8217;s
&#8220;Left Hand,&#8221; but he afforded them diversion,
just then, when they were all a little anxious and downhearted
over their captain&#8217;s departure on what seemed
to some of them a wild-goose chase.</p>

<p>Ferd went through a pantomime of theft. Furtively
putting one hand into his neighbor&#8217;s pocket to instantly
thrust it back into his own. He produced a buckskin
bag and twisting some eucalyptus leaves into rolls, suggesting
those of money, thrust these within the bag and
that within his jacket. Then he glanced about with an
absurdly innocent expression, threw his shoulders back,
and stepped forward a few paces with so firm a step and
erect a bearing that more than one instantly recognized
the mimicry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty-niner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having produced the effect he had intended, Ferd
slouched back into his own natural attitude and begged:</p>

<p>&#8220;Something to eat.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment Ephraim had been approaching and
was an indignant witness of this performance, nor was
he less quick to see its significance than his mates had
been. Also, to him that buckskin bag was a familiar
object. With one stride he collared Ferd and shook
him like a rat.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>&#8220;You imp! What do you mean by that? And how
came you by Elsa Winkler&#8217;s pouch?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ferd broke from his captor and his face changed
color beneath its filth. He was one who was perfectly
satisfied to live in a country where water was scarce;
but, by way of fun, another ranchman caught him as he
escaped from Ephraim, and forcibly ducked his head
and shoulders in the washing-trough. After that he
was let go and later on was given a liberal supper at the
messroom. He ate this as if he had not seen food since
he had gone away two days before, but he was greedy at
all times, and the present instance excited no comment.</p>

<p>The morning came and all was ready for the start.
Every person at Sobrante gathered before the cottage
door, and each with his or her word of farewell advice
or good will. Aunt Sally, fluttering with patchwork
strips of already &#8220;pieced blocks,&#8221; flung jauntily over
either shoulder, her spectacles slipping off the point of
her nose and her hands holding forth a fat fig pie, hot
and dripping from the oven.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been a-bakin&#8217; all night, Ephy. There&#8217;s a pair
of fowls, a ham, four loaves, some hard-boiled eggs,
salt, pepper, sugar, tea, coffee, butter, dishes, five vials
of medicine, some dish towels, some<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What in reason! How expect me to carry that
great basket, as well as the saddlebags, and myself&#8211;on
one horse? You&#8217;re old enough to have sense&#8211;but you&#8217;ll
never learn it. One loaf<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim Marsh! Are you eighty years old or are
you not? At your age would you starve the little darling
daughter of the best friends you ever had? Here,
Jessie. You get off that donkey. We&#8217;ll wait till we
can pick out some other man that<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me the basket; I&#8217;ll carry it if I have to on my
head!&#8221; interrupted &#8220;Forty-niner,&#8221; indignantly. But he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
added to himself: &#8220;I can chuck it into the first clump
of mesquite I meet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica was upon Scruff, whose loss the small boys
were bewailing far more than that of the girl herself.
Without Scruff they would be compelled to stay within
walking distance of the cottage, and this was imprisonment.
Without Jessica&#8211;well, there were many things
one could do better with Jessica away.</p>

<p>Mrs. Trent&#8217;s face was pale but calm. Nobody knew
what this first parting with her helpful child was to her
anxious heart, but it was her part to send the travelers
outward in good cheer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the saddlebags on Scruff, in front of Jessica.
He&#8217;s strong enough to carry double, and they&#8217;re not so
heavy. Few girls, in my days at the East, would have
set out upon an indefinite journey, equipped with only
one flannel frock and a single change of underclothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the flannel frock is new and so is the pretty
Tam that Elsa gave me last Christmas. What do I
want more? specially when there&#8217;s this warm jacket
you made me take, for a cold night&#8217;s ride. Isn&#8217;t it
enough, mother, dear?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite, I think, else I should have made you delay
till I could have provided more. Be sure to write me,
now and then. One of the men will ride to the post
every few days and fetch any letters. Good-by, and
now&#8211;go quickly!&#8221;</p>

<p>She added no prayers, for these were too deep in her
heart for outward utterance; but she felt her own courage
ebbing, and that if the parting were not speedy
she could not at all endure it. Until that moment she
had not realized how complete was her dependence
upon Jessica&#8217;s protecting tenderness; and turning, toward
her home hid thus the tears she would not have
her daughter see.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>But neither could Lady Jess have seen them, because
of the sudden mist in her own. All her eagerness for
the journey was gone, and her courage was fast following
it. If the start were not made at once it would
never be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-by, mother. Good-by, all! Come, Ephraim!
Go, go&#8211;Scruff!&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later the travelers were disappearing down
the sandy road, and upon those whom they had left
behind had fallen an intolerable burden of foreboding
and loneliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Desolation of desolations! That&#8217;s what this old
ranch&#8217;ll be till that there little bunch of human sunshine
comes safely back to it. A crazy trip, a crazy parcel of
folks to let her take it. That&#8217;s what we are,&#8221; said John
Benton, savagely kicking the horseblock to vent his
painful emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! And I never remembered to
put in that guava jell!&#8221; moaned a voice of woe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, mother, just trot it out to us for dinner,&#8221;
said her son, &#8220;we&#8217;ll take that burden off your mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will? Have you a heart to eat good victuals,
John Benton, when that sweet child has just thrust
herself into a den of lions, and lawyers, and liars, and&#8211;and&#8211;things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hush! Lions! The notion!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t deny there&#8217;s bears, anyway,&#8221; she
retorted, with ready dolefulness. &#8220;Ephy&#8217;s shot &#8217;em
himself in his younger days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And ended the crop. Now you go in; and if I hear
you downhearting the mistress the least bit I&#8217;ll
make you take a dose of your own picra,&#8221; said this
much-tried man.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FINISH</span></h2>

<p>It was a journey of something more than two hundred
miles and they were almost a week on the way;
riding for several hours each morning and evening;
camping in some well-watered spot at midday; or, this
failing, sharing the dinner of some friendly ranchman.
Also, they slept at some little inn or ranch, and where
their hosts would receive it, Ephraim delighted to make
liberal payment for their entertainment.</p>

<p>Indeed, he felt a prince, with his well-filled purse,
and would have forced all sorts of dainties and knickknacks
upon his little charge, at each village they
passed through, save that she resolutely refused them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You generous Ephraim, no! What money we need
for the trip and after we get to Los Angeles is all
right. But you mustn&#8217;t waste it. Hear! I am older
than you in this thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8211;I want you to have everything nice in the
world, Lady Jess. Any other of the &#8216;boys&#8217; traveling
with you<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Could not have been so kind and thoughtful as you.
Not one. Dearly as I love them I&#8217;d rather have you to
take care of me on this long journey than any other
single one. So do be good and not extravagant. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
isn&#8217;t it lovely to find how almost everybody knew of my
dear father? Or, if they didn&#8217;t know him for himself,
they&#8217;d heard of him and of something he&#8217;d done for
somebody. It makes the way seem almost short and as
if I&#8217;d been over the road before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He often passed this way, child; and whenever he
went left pleasant memories behind him. He was a
grand man, was Cassius Trent. Ugh! To think<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will be all right, Ephraim. I know it. I feel
it. And how I do love all the new places and things
I see. I should never have cared to leave Sobrante but
for this business; yet now I have left it I&#8217;m finding
the world a big, splendid, lovely place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H-m-m! I reckon even this old earth could show
only its best side to you, little girl. However, it <i>has</i>
been pleasant and it&#8217;s about over. Aunt Sally&#8217;s provisions
didn&#8217;t have to go into the mesquite bushes, after
all. What we couldn&#8217;t eat we&#8217;ve found plenty of others
to take off our hands. Even the medicine didn&#8217;t go begging,
and that&#8217;ll do her proud to hear. Poor wretches
who have to take it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they wanted it, Ephraim. Some of the women
said they hadn&#8217;t had a dose of medicine in years and
seemed as pleased as if it had been sweetmeats. Now
the basket is empty. What shall you do with that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Leave it at the next place we stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had set out upon their ride on Tuesday morning
and this was sunset, Saturday. They were descending
the slope of a mountain and the guide pointed forward,
eagerly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>&#8220;Do you see that hazy spot off yonder? That&#8217;s our
City of the Angels! The city where we shall find
justice and honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, shall we be there to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. We might have been days ago if we&#8217;d ridden
across country and struck the railway lines, but I
wanted to do just as we have done. I knew you&#8217;d hear
so much about your father it would do you good forever.
We can go home the quicker way if we think best;
and if we have good news to take will, likely, so think,
I&#8211;I&#8217;m almost sorry we&#8217;re so near the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In one way so am I. Not in another. I long to begin
to hunt for that money and the men who have it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim sighed. Now that he was thus far on his
mission he began to think it, indeed, as Joe Dean had
said, &#8220;A good deal of the needle and haymow style.&#8221;
But he rallied at once and answered, cheerfully:</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a house I know, or used to, at the foot of
this slope. I planned to sleep there to-night, make an
early start in the morning, and ride the fifteen miles left
so as to get to the town in time for the churches. To
think you&#8217;re eleven years old, Lady Jess, yet have never
been inside any church except the rickety old mission.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you like churches, Ephraim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I do now, child. I didn&#8217;t care so much about
&#8217;em when I lived nigh &#8217;em. But they&#8217;re right. There&#8217;s
a good many kinds of &#8217;em and they get me a little
mixed, arguing. But they&#8217;re right; and the bell<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>It&#8217;ll
be a good beginning of this present job to go to
meeting the first thing.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>&#8220;Oh! this wonderful world and the wonderful things
I&#8217;m learning! What a lot I shall have to tell the folks
when I get home. Seems as if I couldn&#8217;t wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>They found the little lodging-house, as Ephraim
had hoped, though now kept by a stranger to him.
However, the new landlord made them comfortable,
charged them an exorbitant price&#8211;having caught sight
of his guest&#8217;s fat purse&#8211;and set them early on their
way. &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; did not complain. Their next
and final stop would be with an old fellow-miner who,
at Ephraim&#8217;s last visit to Los Angeles, five years before,
had kept a tidy little inn on one of the city&#8217;s central
streets. If this old friend were still living he would
give them hearty welcome, the best entertainment possible,
and what was more to the purpose&#8211;practical
advice as to their business.</p>

<p>&#8220;The bells! The bells! Oh! they are what you said,
the sweetest things I ever heard!&#8221; cried Lady Jess, in
delight, as over the miles of distance there floated to
them on the clear air, the chimes and sonorous tollings
from many church towers.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall be late, after all, I guess. That means it&#8217;s
time for the meetings to begin. Well, there&#8217;ll be others
in the afternoon; so we may as good take it easy and go
slow.&#8221;</p>

<p>This suited Jessica, who found more and more to
surprise and interest her in every stage of their advance,
and most of all as they entered the city. This
was much altered and improved since the sharpshooter
had himself last seen it, but even thus he could point
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
out many of the finest buildings, name the chief avenues,
and comport himself after the manner of one who
knows enlightening one who does not.</p>

<p>But soon Jessica saw few of the things which interested
him and heard him not at all. It was the first
time she had ever seen a girl of her own age, and now&#8211;the streets were full of them. In their gay Sunday
attire, on their homeward way now from the churches
whose bells had long ceased to ring, they were here,
there, and everywhere. They lined the sidewalks and
glittered from the open electric cars. They smiled at
one another and, a few, at her; for to them, also, this
other stranger girl was a novel sight, just then and
there. Besides the oddity of her dress and equipment,
the eagerness and beauty of her face attracted them,
and more than one pair of eyes turned to look after
her, as Scruff scrambled along, unguided by his rider,
and dodging one danger only to face another.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a country girl, fast enough; and if she doesn&#8217;t
look out that uneasy burro will land her on the
curbstone! Look out there, child!&#8221; cried one passerby,
just as the animal bounded across the track of a
whizzing trolley.</p>

<p>But this peril escaped, Ephraim grasped Scruff&#8217;s
bridle and presently led the way into a quieter street
or alley, and thence to the wide plaza before the inn he
sought.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank fortune, there&#8217;s room enough here to turn
around in! And there&#8217;s the very house. Hello! Lady
Jess! I say, Jessica!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>Without warning the girl had whisked the bridle
from his grasp and had chirruped to the now excited
beast in the manner which meant:</p>

<p>&#8220;Go your swiftest!&#8221;</p>

<p>Scruff went. Following he knew not what, and terrified
afresh at every square he traversed. Somewhere
a band of music was playing, and the beating of
the drums seemed to his donkey brain the most horrible
of noises. To escape it and the ever-increasing
throng his nimble feet flew up and down like mad; he
thrust his head between the arms of people and forced
the crowd to part for him; he reared, backed, plunged,
and shook himself; but did not in the least disturb his
mistress&#8217; firm seat, as with her own head leaning forward
she kept her gaze upon some distant object and
urged him to pursuit.</p>

<p>The crowd which made way for this eager pair was
first angry, then amused. After that it began to collect
into a formidable following. Poor Lady Jess became
to them a &#8220;show&#8221; and Scruff&#8217;s antics but meant to exhibit
her &#8220;trick&#8221; riding.</p>

<p>Now Stiffleg was an ancient beast, which had been
a trotter in his day; but his day, like his master&#8217;s, was
past. By good care and easy stages he had accomplished
his long journey in fair condition; but he was a sensible
animal and felt that he had earned a rest. So
when Ephraim urged him forward after the vanishing
burro he halted and turned his head about. If ever
equine eyes protested against further effort, his did
then; and at ordinary times &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span>
been the first to perceive this appeal and grant it. He
had always bragged that &#8220;Stiffleg&#8217;s more human than
most folks,&#8221; but he forgot this now. He remembered
only that his precious charge was fast disappearing
from sight and that in another moment she would be
lost in a great, strange city.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simpleton that I was! I never even mentioned the
name of the tavern we were going to,&#8221; reflected, &#8220;else
she might tell it and get shown the way.&#8221; Then came
another startling thought. For fear of just such an
emergency&#8211;why had he been silly enough to think of
it?&#8211;he had on that very morning, as they neared their
journey&#8217;s end, divided their money into two portions
and make her carry the larger one. She had objected,
at first; but afterward consented, and with pride in his
trust. &#8220;If any scamp got hold of her he&#8217;d rob her or&#8211;maybe worse! Oh, Atlantic! Giddap, Stiff! Giddap,
I tell you!&#8221;</p>

<p>To the crowd this appeared but another feature of
&#8220;the show.&#8221; These rustics from the plains had evidently
come into town to furnish entertainment for
Sunday strollers, and Stiffleg&#8217;s obstinacy was to them
a second of the &#8220;tricks&#8221; to be exhibited.</p>

<p>However, it was a case of genuine balk; and the
more Ephraim urged, implored, chastised, the firmer
were the horse&#8217;s forefeet planted upon the highway
and the more despairing became the rider&#8217;s feeling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Build a fire under him,&#8221; &#8220;Thrust red pepper under
his nose,&#8221; &#8220;Tie him to a trolley car.&#8221; &#8220;Blindfold him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>Various were the suggestions offered, to none of
which did the sharpshooter pay any heed. The brass
band accomplished what nothing else could. Blatantly
it came around the corner, keeping time to its
own noisy drums, and Stiffleg pricked up his ears. In
his youth he had marched to battle and, at that moment,
his youth was renewed. He reared his drooping
head, a thrill ran through his languid veins, and, though
still without advance motion, his hoofs began to beat
a swift tattoo, till the towering plumes of the drum
major came alongside his own now gleaming eyes.
Then, he wheeled suddenly and&#8211;forward!</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho! the old war-horse! That&#8217;s a pretty sight,&#8221;
shouted somebody.</p>

<p>Alas! for Ephraim. The unexpected movement of
the balking animal did for him what was rare indeed&#8211;unseated him. By the time that it was &#8220;right front&#8221;
for Stiffleg his master was on the ground, feeling that
an untoward fate had overtaken him and that his leg,
if not his heart, was broken. Music had charms, in
truth, for the rejuvenated beast, and one of the sharpshooter&#8217;s
pet theories was thereby proved false. Had
anybody at Sobrante told him that anything could
entice his &#8220;faithful&#8221; horse away from him he
would have denied the statement angrily. He would
have declared, with equal conviction, that, in case of
accident like this, the intelligent creature would have
stayed beside and tried to tend him.</p>

<p>Now, lying forsaken both by Jessica and Stiffleg, he
uttered his shame and misery in a prolonged howl, as
he attempted to rise and could not.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;O! Ough! Oh! My leg&#8217;s broke! My leg&#8217;s broke
all to smash, I tell you. Somebody pick me up and
carry me&#8211;yonder&#8211;to the Yankee Blade. If Tom
Jefferts keeps it still, he&#8217;ll play my friend. Oh! Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>Some in the now pitying throng exchanged glances,
and one man bent over the prostrate Ephraim, saying,
kindly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Tom Jefferts hasn&#8217;t been in this town these
three years. He went to &#8217;Frisco and set up there. If
there&#8217;s anybody else you&#8217;d like to notify I&#8217;ll telephone<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He gone, too! Then let me lie. What do I care
what becomes of me now? Oh! my leg!&#8221;</p>

<p>The bravest men are cowards before physical suffering,
sometimes. Ephraim would have faced death for
Jessica without flinching, but that gathering agony of
pain made him indifferent, for the moment, even to her
welfare. This calamity had fallen upon him like
lightning from a clear sky and benumbed him, so to
speak. But it had not benumbed those about him.
Within five minutes the clang of an ambulance gong
was heard, and the aid which some thoughtful person
had summoned arrived. Ephraim was tenderly lifted
and placed within the conveyance, and away it dashed
again, though almost without jar, and certainly without
hindrance, since everything on the street gives
place to suffering.</p>

<p>By the time the hospital was reached the patient
had recovered something of his customary fortitude,
but he was still too confused and distressed to think
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
clearly about his escaped charge and what should be
done to find her. As for Stiffleg:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I&#8217;ll never see that cowardly, ungrateful
beast again!&#8221; he ejaculated; then resigned himself to
the surgeon&#8217;s hands.</p>

<p>That which Lady Jess had perceived in the distance
and had followed so wildly was the tall figure of a gentleman
in a gray suit. He wore a gray hat and blue
glasses, such as her mother had pressed upon Mr.
Hale&#8217;s acceptance during his brief stay at Sobrante.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s he! It certainly is he! Oh! Now I can tell
him how sorry both mother and I were that the &#8216;boys&#8217;
behaved so rudely. And he&#8217;s a lawyer. He&#8217;s on the
same business we are, if his is the other side. I must
stop him&#8211;quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>This might have been an easy thing to do, under
Scruff&#8217;s present rate of speed; but, unfortunately, the
tall man stepped into a hack, waiting beside the plaza
for stray passengers, and giving an order was driven
rapidly away.</p>

<p>For a long time Jessica kept that carriage in sight;
then it turned a corner into an avenue, where were
hundreds more just like it, it seemed to her, and she
lost it among the many.</p>

<p>Even yet she pressed on determined. &#8220;In a city&#8211;it&#8217;s
just one city, even if it is a big one&#8211;I shall find him
if I keep on. I must. Go, Scruff! The band is after
you. Go! Go!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>The overtaxed burro had already &#8220;gone&#8221; to his fullest
ability. He could do no more, although his mistress
whispered &#8220;sugar,&#8221; &#8220;sweet cake&#8221; and other tempting
words. His excited pace dropped to the slowest of
walks, his breath came hardly, and finally he leaned
himself against a post and rested. When he had done
so for some moments, Jessica turned him about and
looked backward, expecting to see Ephraim close behind.
But he was nowhere in sight; and in a flash of
horror the girl realized that she was lost.</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>A NEW FRIEND FOR THE OLD</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Lost! I&#8217;m lost! Right here in this great city full
of folks. It seemed so easy to find Mr. Hale and it
was so hard. There are so many streets&#8211;which one
is right? There are so many people&#8211;oh! if they&#8217;d
stop going by for just one minute, till I could think.&#8221;</p>

<p>The passing crowd that had so interested now terrified
her. Among all the changing faces not one she
knew, not one that more than glanced her way, and was
gone on, indifferent. The memory of a time in her
early childhood when she had strayed into the canyon
and became bewildered flashed through her mind. Was
she to suffer again the misery of that dreadful day?
But the day had ended in a father&#8217;s rescuing arms, and
now<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I remember he told me then that if ever I were
lost again I was to keep perfectly still for a time and
think over all the things I&#8217;d seen by the way. After
awhile I might feel sure enough to go slowly back and
guide myself by them. But I can&#8217;t think here. It&#8217;s so
noisy and thick with men and women. And I&#8217;m getting
so hungry. Ephraim said we would have the best
dinner his friend could give us. If he&#8217;d told me that
friend&#8217;s name or where he lived. Well, I&#8217;ll mind my
father in one thing; I&#8217;ll keep still. Then if Ephraim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
should happen to come this way he&#8217;d find me sooner.
But&#8211;he won&#8217;t. Something has happened, or he&#8217;d
never let me out of sight. If I didn&#8217;t know the bigness
of a city he did and would have taken care.&#8221;</p>

<p>So she dismounted and led Scruff back beside the
telegraph post, against which the weary animal calmly
leaned his shoulder and went to sleep. Jessica threw
her arm over the burro&#8217;s neck and, standing so, scanned
every passing pedestrian and peered into every whirling
vehicle.</p>

<p>Something of her first terror left her. She was foolish
to think anything harmful could have happened to
&#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; so quickly after she had run away from
him. She wished she had called and explained to him,
but she had had no time if she would catch up to that
gray-coated gentleman. After all they were still in
the same city and all she needed was patience.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I have so little of, too. Maybe this is
a lesson to me. Mother says impatient people always
find life harder than the quiet kind. I wonder what
she&#8217;s doing now! and oh! I&#8217;m glad she can&#8217;t see me.
She&#8217;d suffer more than I do. It&#8217;s queer how that man,
in a fancy coat, with so many brass buttons, keeps
looking at me. He&#8217;s walked by this place on one side
the street or the other ever so many times. I wonder if
he owns this post. Maybe it&#8217;s his and he doesn&#8217;t like
us to stand here, yet is too polite to say so. Come,
Scruff, let&#8217;s walk a little further along. Then he can
see we don&#8217;t mean to hurt his post.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>Scruff reluctantly roused and moved a pace or two,
then went to sleep again. The shadow of a building
that had sheltered them from the hot sunshine passed
gradually and left them exposed to the full glare from
the sky. Both Jessica and the burro were used to heat,
however, and did not greatly suffer from it. But this
motionless waiting became almost intolerable to active
Lady Jess, and the sharpness of her hunger changed
into faintness. The sidewalks seemed to be rising up
to strike her and her head felt queer; so she pulled the
hot Tam from her curls, leaned her cheek against
Scruff&#8217;s neck, and, to clear her dizzy vision, closed her
eyes. Then for a long time knew no more.</p>

<p>A young man sat down to smoke his after-dinner
cigar before the window of a clubhouse across the way.
Idly observant of the comparatively few persons passing
at that hour, his artist eye was caught by the scarlet
gleam of Jessica&#8217;s cap, fallen against the curbstone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! That child has been in that spot for two
hours, I think. She was there before I went to dinner
and must be dead tired. But she and the burro are
picturesque&#8211;I&#8217;ll sketch them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He whipped out notebook and pencil and by a few
skillful lines reproduced the pair opposite. But as
he glanced toward them, now and then, during this operation,
he became convinced that something was amiss
with his subject.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor little thing! If she&#8217;s waiting for anybody
she keeps the baby too long. I&#8217;m going over and speak
to her. If she&#8217;s hungry I&#8217;ll send her a sandwich.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>At his touch on her shoulder Jessica roused. Her
sleep had refreshed her, though she was still somewhat
confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Ephraim! How long you&#8217;ve been! Why&#8211;it
isn&#8217;t Ephraim!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, little girl, I&#8217;m not Ephraim, but I&#8217;m a friend.
I&#8217;m afraid you will be ill standing so long in the hot
sun. Are you waiting for anybody?&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice was kind and Jessica was glad to speak to
any one. She told her story at once in a few words.
The young man&#8217;s face grew grave as he listened, still
he spoke encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite easy for strangers in a big place to get
separated. Suppose, since you haven&#8217;t had your dinner,
as I guess, that you go with me and have some.
Wait, I&#8217;ll just speak to that policeman, yonder, and ask
him to have a lookout for your Ephraim, while we&#8217;re
in the restaurant. There&#8217;s a good place halfway down
the block, and from its window you can watch the
burro for yourself. I&#8217;ll tie him, shan&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very tired. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll need any tying.
He&#8217;s never tied at Sobrante.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sobrante? Are you from Sobrante? Why, I&#8217;ve
heard of that ranch, myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you? That makes it seem as if I knew you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger smiled and beckoned to the policeman,
who proved to be the brass-buttoned individual that
had taken so much apparent interest in Jessica, but had
not spoken to her of his own accord. He came forward
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span>
promptly now and the young man related to him
what Lady Jess had said. Then asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What would I better do about it? I thought of
taking her to the restaurant over there and getting her
some dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. She&#8217;d better go to the station-house with me.
The matron&#8217;ll look after her and I&#8217;ll have the donkey
put in stable. I&#8217;ll tell the officer who&#8217;s coming on this
beat now to keep an eye out for a countryman with a
stiff-legged horse; is it, girl?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. A bay horse, with a blazed face. The horse&#8217;s
name is Stiffleg and the master&#8217;s, Ephraim Marsh.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer made the entry in his book, then took
hold of Scruff&#8217;s bridle and led the way stationward.
Jessica looked appealingly into the young man&#8217;s face
and he smiled, then grasped her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t fear, child, that I&#8217;ll desert you till I find your
old guardian. There&#8217;s nothing frightful about a station-house,
except to criminals,&#8221; he said, kindly.</p>

<p>However, Jessica knew nothing of such institutions
and therefore had no fear of them. With the exception
of Antonio&#8217;s &#8220;crossness&#8221; she had met with nothing
but love and kindness all her life, and she looked for
nothing else. She was already happy again at finding
two persons ready to talk with her and help her; and
her pretty face grew more and more charming to the
artist&#8217;s view as she skipped along beside him toward
the police headquarters, as this station chanced to be.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>&#8220;You see, little girl, that when a child is lost in a
city the first thing the friends think of is&#8211;the station-house.
All stray persons are taken and messages are
sent to it from every part of the town all the time.
That Ephraim will remember that, if he&#8217;s ever been
here before, and he&#8217;ll be finding you long before night.
Till then you&#8217;ll be safe and cared for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica did feel a moment&#8217;s hesitation when she had
to part with Scruff, but soon laughed at her own dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt as I must take him inside this building with
me, for fear he&#8217;d be lonesome, too. But, of course, I
know better. Why, what a nice, big place this is!&#8221;</p>

<p>By far the largest building she had ever entered, but
her new acquaintances smiled at her delight over it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not all who come here think it so fine,&#8221; said the
young man. &#8220;Eh, officer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no. No, indeed, sir. Now, this way, please.
I&#8217;ll just enter the case at the desk and call up the
matron. She&#8217;ll tend to the girl all right. You needn&#8217;t
bother any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! are you going?&#8221; asked Jessica, her face drooping.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. No law against my having a meal with
this young lady, is there, officer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it isn&#8217;t at the public charge, sir,&#8221; answered the
policeman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I&#8217;ve money to pay for my own dinner. See?&#8221;
cried Lady Jess, producing the fat wallet Ephraim had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
given her and which she pulled from within her blouse,
where she had worn it, suspended by a string.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! child! All that? Put it up, quick. Put it
up, I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>Instinctively she obeyed and hid the purse again, but
her face expressed her surprise, and the young man answered
its unspoken question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very few little girls of your age ever have so much
money as that about them. None ever should have.
It&#8217;s too great a temptation to evil-minded persons, and
a good many of that sort come here. Ah! the matron!
I&#8217;ll ask her to show us into some less public place and
I&#8217;ll order a dinner from that restaurant nearby.&#8221;</p>

<p>In response to his request the motherly woman in
charge of the women&#8217;s quarters offered him her own
little sitting-room; &#8220;if they&#8217;ll say yes to it in the office,&#8221;
she added, as a condition.</p>

<p>This was soon arranged, the dinner followed and
a very hungry Jessica sat down to enjoy it. Her companion
also pretended to eat, but encouraged her to
talk and found himself interested in her every moment.
He, also, promptly told her who he was; a reporter
and occasional artist, on one of the leading daily papers.
A man always on the lookout for &#8220;material,&#8221; and as
such he meant to use the sketch, he had made. He
showed her the sketch, and explained that he
would put an item in the next issue of his paper which
might meet the eye of the missing sharpshooter and notify
that person where to find her, if he had not done
so before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>Jessica did not know that it was an unwise thing to
make a confidant of a stranger, but in this instance
she was safe enough; and it pleased her to tell, as
him to listen to, the whole history of Sobrante; its fortunes
and misfortunes, and the object of her present
visit to this far-off town.</p>

<p>His business instinct was aroused. He realized
that here might be &#8220;material,&#8221; indeed. He was young
and sincere enough to be enthusiastic. Times were a
little dull. There was quite a lull in murders and robberies;
this story suggested either a robbery or swindle
of some sort, and on a big scale. His paper would appreciate
his getting a &#8220;scoop&#8221; on its contemporaries,
and, in a word, he resolved to make Jessica Trent&#8217;s
cause his own, for the time being.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here, child, don&#8217;t you worry. You stay right
quiet in this place with Matron Wood. I&#8217;ll get out and
hustle. Here&#8217;s my card, Ninian Sharp, of <i>The Lancet</i>.
That&#8217;s a paper has cut a good many knots and shall
cut yours. I&#8217;ve heard of Cassius Trent. Everybody
has, in California. I&#8217;ll find that Lawyer Hale. I&#8217;ll
find old &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; and I&#8217;ll be back in this room before
bedtime. Now, go play with the rest of the lost
children&#8211;you&#8217;re by no means the only one in Los Angeles
to-day. Or take a nap would be wiser. Look
out for her, Matron Wood. Any good turn done this
little maid is done <i>The Lancet</i>. Good-by, for a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smiling, alert, he departed and Jessica felt as if he
had taken all her anxieties with him. She followed
the matron into the big room where the other estrays,
whom Mr. Sharp had told her she would find, waiting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
to be claimed by their friends, but none was as large
as she. Some were so little she wondered how they
ever could have wandered anywhere away from home;
but she loved all children and these reminded her of
Ned and Luis.</p>

<p>Promptly she had them all about her, and for the rest
of that day, at least, Matron Wood&#8217;s cares were lightened.
Yet one after another, some person called to
claim this or that wanderer, with cries of rapture or
harsh words of reproof, as the case might be. Jessica
kissed each little one good-by, but with each departure
felt herself growing more homesick and depressed. By
sunset she was the only child left in the matron&#8217;s care,
and her loneliness so overcame her that she had trouble
to keep back her tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ll not cry. I will not be so babyish. Besides
crying wouldn&#8217;t help bad matters and I&#8217;ve come
away from Sobrante on a big mission. Even that
jolly Mr. Sharp said, &#8216;That's a considerable of a job,&#8217;
when I told him. He was funny. Always laughing
and so quick, I wish he&#8217;d come soon. It seems to
take as long for him to find Ephraim as it would me. I
should think anybody could have walked the whole
city over by this time,&#8221; she thought, in her ignorance
of distances. Then she asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you think they&#8217;ll come, Matron Wood?&#8221;</p>

<p>The good woman waked from a &#8220;cat-nap&#8221; and was
tired enough to be impatient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! don&#8217;t bother. If they&#8217;re not here by nine
o&#8217;clock you&#8217;ll have to go to bed. You should be thankful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
that there is such a place as this for just such folks
as you. Like as not he&#8217;ll never come. You can&#8217;t tell anything
about them newspaper men. But you listen to
that bell, will you? I don&#8217;t see what makes me so
sleepy. If it rings, wake me up.&#8221;</p>

<p>The minutes sped on. In the now silent room the
portly matron slumbered peacefully and Jessica tried,
though vainly, to keep a faithful watch. She did not
know that her weary companion was breaking rules
and laying herself open to disgrace; but she was herself
very tired, so, presently, her head dropped on the
table and she was also asleep.</p>

<p>Ninian Sharp found the pair thus, and jested with
the matron when he waked her in a way that sounded
very much like earnest. &#8220;He would have her removed,&#8221;
and so on; thereby frightening Jessica, who had been
roused by their voices, and looked from one to the
other in keen distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did&#8211;I did try to listen for the bell, but it was so
still and I couldn&#8217;t help it. I&#8217;m sorry<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! child. No more could I. It&#8217;ll be all right if
this gentleman knows enough to hold his tongue,&#8221; said
the woman, anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be a gentleman if I didn&#8217;t&#8211;where a
lady is concerned. And I judge from appearances it&#8217;s
about time Miss Jessica went to bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>The girl&#8217;s heart sank. This meant disappointment.
She understood that without further words, and turned
away her face to hide the tears which would come now,
in spite of all her will.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>Then the reporter&#8217;s hand was on her curls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep up your courage, child. I&#8217;ve been hustling,
as I said I would. I&#8217;ve found out a lot. I&#8217;ve had boys
searching the hotel records all over town and I know in
which one your Mr. Hale is staying. He&#8217;ll keep&#8211;till
we need him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Ephraim? Have you heard nothing of him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard a funny yarn about a horse with a stiff leg;
that the moment the sound of a drum was in his ears
cooly tossed his aged rider into the gutter and marched
off with the brass band, head up, eyes flashing, tail
switching, a soldier with the best of them. See&#8211;it&#8217;s
here in this evening&#8217;s <i>Gossip.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>He held the sheet toward her and Jessica read the
humorous account of Stiffleg&#8217;s desertion. But there
was no account of what had further befallen Ephraim,
and it seemed but a poor excuse for his non-appearance.</p>

<p>She tossed the paper aside, impatiently:</p>

<p>&#8220;But he had his own two good feet left. He could
have followed me on them? I&#8211;I&#8211;he was always so
faithful before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp&#8217;s face sobered.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is faithful still, but his feet will serve him
poorly for the next few weeks. Maybe months. Old
bones are slow to heal, and the surgeon says it is a
compound fracture. When he fell into the gutter, as my
co-laborer so gayly puts it, he &#8216;broke himself all to
smash.&#8217; He&#8217;s in hospital. As a great favor from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
authorities in charge I&#8217;ve seen him. I&#8217;ve told him about
you. I&#8217;ve promised to befriend you and I&#8217;ll take you
to see him in the morning. I&#8217;m sorry that your first
night in our angelic city must be passed in a station-house,
but I reckon it&#8217;s the safest till I can think of
some fitter shelter. Good-night. My mother used to
say that the Lord never shut one door but He opened
another. Ephraim laid up&#8211;here am I. Count on me.
Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span><a id='link_16'></a>CHAPTER XVI<br /><span class='h2fs'>A HOSPITAL REUNION</span></h2>

<p>When Ninian Sharp sat down to smoke a cigar at the
window of his club it was with no idea that he was then
and there to begin a bit of detective work which
should make him famous. For, though this is anticipating,
that was the reward which the future held
for him because of his yielding to a kindly impulse.</p>

<p>Through him, the helplessness of a little girl won for
an almost hopeless cause the aid of a great newspaper,
than which there is no influence more potent. It took
but one hearing of Jessica&#8217;s story to rouse his interest
and to convince him that here was a &#8220;good thing if it
could be well worked up.&#8221; It promised a &#8220;sensation&#8221;
that would result in benefit to his paper, to himself, and&#8211;for his credit be it said&#8211;to the family of the dead
philanthropist.</p>

<p>After he had bidden Lady Jess good-night, the reporter
called at the hotel where Morris Hale was registered
and held an interview with that gentleman. The
result of this was pleasing to both men. They had one
common object: the recovery of the missing money
which had been entrusted to Cassius Trent. Mr. Hale
wished this for the sake of his New York patrons, but
now hoped, as did Ninian Sharp, that if it were accomplished
it would also clear the memory of Jessica&#8217;s father
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span>
from the stain resting upon it. For the present,
they decided to join forces, so to speak. By agreement,
they went together to the station-house on the
following morning, and found Lady Jess looking out
of a window with a rather dreary interest in the scene.
But she instantly caught sight of them and darted to
the doorway to meet them, holding out both hands toward
the lawyer and entreating:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! I beg your pardon for the &#8216;boys&#8217;! And for
us that we should ever have let it happen to any guest
of Sobrante. Can you forgive it?&#8221;</p>

<p>The reporter looked curious and Mr. Hale&#8217;s face
flushed at the painful memory her words had revived.
But he did not explain and passed the matter over,
saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it, my child. Odd, isn&#8217;t it? To
think you should follow me so quickly all this long way.
Well, you deserve success and I&#8217;m going to help you
to it, if I can. So is this new friend you&#8217;ve made. Now,
are you ready to see poor &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217;? If so, get
your cap, bid the matron good-by, and we&#8217;ll be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica obeyed, quickly; taking leave of Mrs. Wood
with warm expressions of gratitude for her &#8220;nice bed
and breakfast,&#8221; assuring that rather skeptical person
that these men &#8220;were certainly all right, because one
of them had been at her own dear home and her
mother had recognized him for a gentleman. The
other&#8211;why, the other wrote for a newspaper. Even
drew pictures for it! Think of that!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>&#8220;Humph! A man might do worse. But, never mind.
This is the place to come to if you get into any more
trouble. There&#8217;s the street and number it is, and here&#8217;s
my name on a piece of paper. Now, it&#8217;s to be put in
the book about your going, who takes you, and where.
After that&#8211;after that I suppose there&#8217;s nothing more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ninian Sharp watched this little by-play with much
interest, and remarked to the lawyer:</p>

<p>&#8220;That child has a charm for all she meets. Even
this old police matron, whose heart ought to be as
tough as shoeleather, looks doleful at parting with her.
I think her the most winning little creature I ever
met.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should see her with her &#8216;boys,&#8217; as she calls the
workmen at Sobrante. They idolize her and obey her
blindly. Sometimes, their devotion going further than
obedience,&#8221; he added, with a return of annoyance in
his expression.</p>

<p>As she stepped into the street, Jessica clasped a hand
of each, with joyful confidence, and they smiled at one
another over her head, leading her to the next corner
where they hailed a car and the reporter bade her jump
aboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I to ride in that? Oh, delightful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Delightful&#8221; now seemed everything about her.
Friends were close at hand and a few minutes would
bring her to Ephraim. That he was injured and helpless
she knew, yet could not realize; while she could
and did realize to the full all the novelty about her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
The swift motion of the electric car, the gay and busy
streets, the palm-bordered avenues they crossed, the
ever-changing scenes of the city, each richer and more
wonderful than the other, in her inexperienced eyes.
She would have liked to ask many questions, but her
companions were now conversing in low tones and she
would not interrupt. Soon, however, she saw Mr.
Sharp make a slight gesture with his hand and the car
stopped. &#8220;Our street,&#8221; he said, rising.</p>

<p>A brief walk afterward brought them to a big building,
standing somewhat back from the avenue, with a
green lawn and many trees about it. Above the several
gateways of its iron fence were signs, indicating:
&#8220;Accident Ward,&#8221; &#8220;Convalescent&#8217;s Ward,&#8221; &#8220;General
Hospital,&#8221; &#8220;Nurses&#8217; Home,&#8221; &#8220;Dispensary,&#8221; etc., all of
which confused and somewhat startled the country-reared
girl. The more, it may be, as, at that moment,
the gong of an ambulance warned them to step off the
crossing before the &#8220;accident&#8221; alley beside the main
building, and the big van dashed toward an open door.</p>

<p>Jessica gripped Mr. Hale&#8217;s hand, nervously, and
watched in a sort of fascination while white-garbed
attendants lifted an injured man from the ambulance
and carried him tenderly into the hospital.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&#8211;is he hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear, I suppose so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it like that they brought Ephraim here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! how dreadful! My poor, poor &#8216;Forty-niner.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>&#8220;Rather, how merciful. But come; such a brave little
woman as you mustn&#8217;t show the white feather at
the mere sight of a hospital van. Ephraim has been
well cared for, be sure; and as he has been told to expect
you he&#8217;ll be disappointed if you bring him a
scared, unhappy face.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll&#8211;I&#8217;ll smile,&#8221; she answered, promptly,
thought the effort was something of a failure.</p>

<p>Soon they entered the building, whose big halls
were so silent in contrast with the street outside, and
where the white-clad doctors and nurses seemed to
Jessica like &#8220;ghosts&#8221; as they moved softly here and
there. Again she clinched the lawyer&#8217;s hand and whispered:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful. It smells queer. I&#8217;m afraid. Aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not in the least. I like it. I&#8217;ve been a patient in
just such places more than once and think of them as
the most blessed institutions in the world. The odor
of chemicals and disinfectants is noticeable at first,
but one soon gets accustomed to it and likes it. At any
rate I do. But, see, we&#8217;re falling behind. Mr. Sharp
evidently knows his way well and we must hurry if
we&#8217;d keep him in sight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, the reporter was just disappearing around a
turn of the broad staircase leading up into a sun-lighted
corridor. He was quick and decided in all his movements,
and had paused but for one instant to speak
with an attendant at the door before he took his
direct way to Ephraim&#8217;s room.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>&#8220;Why, I supposed he was in the general ward&#8221; said
Mr. Hale, as he joined Ninian, who had to stop and
wait for his more leisurely advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was, but he couldn&#8217;t stand it. So I had him put
into a private room and he&#8217;s much better satisfied. He
has money enough to pay for it and if he hadn&#8217;t&#8211;well,
it was just pitiful to see the old man&#8217;s own distress
at sight of the distress of others all about him.
I&#8217;d have had to do it, even if it had taken my bottom
dollar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True to your class! I&#8217;ve always heard that newspaper
men were the most generous in the world, and
now I believe it. Well, count me in, on this transaction.
But when were you here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Last night and&#8211;early this morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! If you put such energy as that into the
rest of the business you&#8217;ll make a speedy finish of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my intention. Well, child, here we are. Put
your best foot forward and cheer up that forlorn old
chap.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica had paused to look down a great ward, opening
upon that corridor, and was staring, spellbound,
at the rows upon rows of white beds, each with its occupant,
and at the white-capped nurses bending over this
or that sufferer. The wide, uncurtained windows, all
open to the soft morning air, the snowy walls, the
cleanliness and repose impressed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;it&#8217;s nice! I thought it would be dreadful;
and where is Ephraim? Can I go in? How shall I find
him among so many?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand? This way, I said, Lady
Jess. The sharpshooter wants to see his captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned swiftly at that, and the smile he had
hoped to rouse was on her face as she caught the reporter&#8217;s
hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&#8211;how did you know <i>that?</i> Who told you I
was Lady Jess, or captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who but &#8216;Forty-niner&#8217; himself? Here he is,&#8221; and
he gently forced her through an open doorway into
a little room, which seemed a miniature of the great
ward beyond. There was the same white spotlessness,
another kind-faced nurse, and another prostrate patient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim! Ephraim! You poor, dear, precious darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was beside him, her arms about his neck, her
tears and kisses raining on his wrinkled face&#8211;a face
that a moment before had been full of sadness and impatience,
but was now brimming with delight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Little Lady! Little captain! I&#8217;m a pretty sort
of a guardeen, I am! But, thank God, I&#8217;m not the
only man in the world, and you&#8217;ve found them that can
help you more than I could, with all my smartness. Did
you hear about that turn-tail, Stiffleg? Wasn&#8217;t that
enough to make a man disgusted with horseflesh forever
after? Ugh! I wish I had him, I&#8217;d larrup him
crossing before the &#8216;accident&#8217; alley beside the main
well! And to think you, Cassius Trent&#8217;s daughter,
spent your first night in town at a station-house! Child,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
I&#8217;ll never dare to go home and face the &#8216;boys&#8217; again,
after that. Never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk too much, sir,&#8221; cautioned the nurse,
offering her patient a spoonful of some nourishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Ephraim, I&#8217;ll talk. Oh! what wouldn&#8217;t Aunt
Sally give to be here now! To think she&#8217;s lost such
a chance for dosing you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; laughed and the laughter did him
good; though he soon explained: &#8220;They say I&#8217;ll have
to lie here for nobody knows how long, without moving,
scarcely. That pesky old leg of mine did the job
up thorough, while it was at it. Thought it might
as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb, I s&#8217;pose. Well, it
was the luckiest thing ever happened&#8211;you getting lost
and me getting hurt. That&#8217;s the only way to look at it.
But&#8211;Atlantic! How&#8217;m I ever going to stand it?
Having other folks do for you and I, that&#8217;d give my
right hand to help you&#8211;useless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easily, Ephraim. If it&#8217;s a good thing, as you say,
why then it can&#8217;t be a bad one. Here&#8217;s your money.
You must use it to pay for anything you want. Or
give it all to Mr. Hale about the business. You know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Money! I don&#8217;t want that. All I had they took
away from me. Put it in the hospital safe till I&#8217;m
ready to go out. But you can&#8217;t live in a city without
hard cash in every pocket. Oh! dear! I don&#8217;t see
what is to be done! One minute it all is clear and I
think what I said about my accident being lucky for
you; the next&#8211;I can&#8217;t stand it. What is to become of
you, little captain?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to stay right here with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are? You will?&#8221; demanded the patient,
eagerly. &#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be afraid? But, maybe, you
wouldn&#8217;t be allowed. Hospitals are for sick folks and
old fools that don&#8217;t know enough to sit a horse steady.
They&#8217;re not for a happy little girl, who can make new
friends for herself anywhere. No. I guess, maybe,
that Mr. Hale&#8217;ll find you a place, or get you on the cars
to go home again. Oh! child, I wish you were safe
back at Sobrante this minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And our work not done? Foolish &#8216;boy!&#8217; As if I&#8217;d
leave you alone, either, when you&#8217;re ill and&#8211;and Aunt
Sally so far away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ephraim groaned and Jessica looked toward the reporter,
who was talking earnestly with the nurse, just
outside in the corridor. She heard him say:</p>

<p>&#8220;If it could be arranged it would be a solution of the
whole difficulty. Her board would be assured, and at
the first opportunity she shall be sent to her home. For
the present<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt it no shame to listen intently. She knew
that they were discussing herself and what was to be
done with her. On that subject she had already made
up her own mind; so she slipped her hand from Ephraim&#8217;s
and stepped to Mr. Sharp&#8217;s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to say right here in this hospital. I will not
make anybody a bit of trouble. I will mind everything
I am told. I&#8217;ll not talk or laugh or anything I
should not. I&#8217;ll help take care of Ephraim and there&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>
nobody who knows him here but me. He&#8217;s the best man
there can be, and he&#8217;s old, though he doesn&#8217;t look it.
Please let me stay. Anyway until all the money is
spent. There&#8217;s enough for a while, I think. Please.&#8221;</p>

<p>In answer to the reporter&#8217;s look, rather than Jessica&#8217;s
words, the nurse replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we do often have friends of the patients here.
If there happen to be rooms empty and so to spare.
But a child&#8211;we never had a child-boarder before.
I&#8217;ll consult the head nurse and let you know at once.
Or, better why not go and see her for yourself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d much prefer,&#8221; said Ninian, who had more faith
in his own persuasive powers than in hers. &#8220;And I&#8217;ll
take Jessica with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The result was that the little girl was allowed to
&#8220;remain for the present,&#8221; and was assigned a room
very near Ephraim&#8217;s. Upon her good behavior, as
viewed from a hospital standpoint, depended the continuance
of her stay.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can have her clothes sent here, but only what
are necessary,&#8221; added the lady, as she dismissed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;My clothes! Why&#8211;I don&#8217;t know where they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! What do you mean? I&#8211;I never thought
about clothes,&#8221; said Ninian Sharp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I, before, since I came. I had only a change of
underwear and another flannel frock. Ephraim was
to buy me more if I needed, though mother thought I
should not. But what I did have were in the saddlebags
on Stiffleg&#8217;s back.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>&#8220;And he marched off to glory with them, the old
soldier, eh? Well, that&#8217;s soon remedied. There are
lots of stores in Los Angeles and lots of girls your
size. I&#8217;ll get a nurse to fix you out, when she can, and
now, back to Ephraim and good-by.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span><a id='link_17'></a>CHAPTER XVII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE FINDING OF ANTONIO</span></h2>

<p>For Jessica Trent there followed weeks of a quieter
life than she had lived even at isolated Sobrante. &#8220;The
behavior,&#8221; which was to be a test of her stay, proved
so pleasing to the hospital residents that some of them
wondered how they had ever gotten along without
her helpful, happy presence.</p>

<p>Very quickly she lost her first vague fear of the
place and learned to hear in the once alarming ambulance
gong the signal of relief to somebody. She modulated
her voice to the prevailing quietude of the
house and her footfalls were as light as the nurses
themselves. To many a sufferer, coming there in dread
and foreboding, the sight of a child familiar and happy
about the great building brought a feeling of comfort
and homelikeness which nothing else could have given.
She was so apt and imitative that Ephraim often declared:</p>

<p>&#8220;All you need, Lady Jess, is a cap and apron to make
you a regular professional. Take care of me better&#8217;n
any of &#8217;em, you do; and I&#8217;ll be a prime experience for
you, that&#8217;s a fact. Another of the good things come
out of my fool riding, I s&#8217;pose. You&#8217;ll be able to nurse
the whole parcel of us, when you get back to Sobrante.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
Beat Aunt Sally all hollow, &#8217;cause you trust a bit to
nature and not all to&#8211;picra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not ill, Ephraim Marsh. You&#8217;re just
broken. So you don&#8217;t need medicine. All you need
is patience. And your nourishments, regular.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I get them all right; but&#8211;<i>patience!</i> Atlantic!&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man sighed. It was weary work for him,
the hardest he had ever done, to lie so motionless while
he was so anxious to be active. He really suffered
little and he had the best of care. Still, he sighed again,
and, unfortunately, Jessica echoed the sigh. Then he
looked at her keenly and spoke the thought which had
been in his mind for a long time:</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain, you must go home. There&#8217;s twenty to
need bossing there and only one poor old carcass here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Lady Jess! She tried to answer brightly
as was her habit, but that day homesickness was strong
upon her, and at mention of Sobrante her courage
failed. She forgot that she was a &#8220;nurse&#8221;; forgot
the good &#8220;behavior,&#8221; forgot everything, indeed, but
her mother&#8217;s face and Ned&#8217;s mischievous affection. She
dropped to her knees and buried her face in the old
man&#8217;s pillow while she sobbed aloud:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8216;Forty-niner,&#8217; shall we ever see that home
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Weak and unstrung, the patient moaned in sympathy,
while tears fell from his own eyes; and it was
upon this dismal tableau that Mr. Hale walked in,
unannounced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>&#8220;Hurrah, here! What&#8217;s amiss? Been quarreling?
Just when I&#8217;ve come to bring you good news, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quarreling, indeed! Ephraim and I could never
quarrel. Never. But&#8211;but&#8211;this isn&#8217;t Sobrante, and
we&#8217;re&#8211;I guess we&#8217;re awful homesick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a disease can be cured, you know. One of
you, at least, can go home. If you wish, Jessica, I
will put you on a train and arrange for one of your
&#8216;boys&#8217; to meet you at the railway terminus. But<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, everybody!&#8221; called a cheery voice, and there
in the doorway was Ninian Sharp, smiling, nodding,
and embracing all three with one inspiring look.
&#8220;What&#8217;s that I overheard about &#8216;home&#8217;? Been telling
state secrets, Hale? My plan beats yours, altogether.
We&#8217;re all going &#8216;home&#8217; to Sobrante, in a bunch, one of
these fine days. <i>The Lancet</i> never fails!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica sprang to him and caught his hand to kiss it.
He had not been to see them for some days and she
had missed him sadly. Far more than Mr. Hale he
made her feel that the mystery surrounding &#8220;that
missing New York money,&#8221; as she called it, would certainly
be explained. It was he who, by questions innumerable,
had recalled to her and to Ephraim the
names of persons with whom Mr. Trent had ever done
business. Incidents which to her seemed trifling had
been of moment in his judgment. With the slight
clews they had given him, as the first link in the chain,
he had gone on unraveling the knots which followed
with infinite patience and perseverance. He kept Mrs.
Trent informed of the welfare of her daughter, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
without neglecting his legitimate business, did the thousand
and one things which only the busiest of persons
can have time to do. For it&#8217;s always the indolent who
are overcrowded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! Mr. Sharp! Have you found it all out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not I. Hale, here, has found out some things,
himself. But he&#8217;s a lawyer, which means, a&#8211;beg pardon&#8211;a
snail. If newspapers were as slow as the law&#8211;h-m-m&#8211;we
might all take a nap. Look here, Miss
Sunshine, you&#8217;ve been crying.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica blushed as guiltily as if she had been accused
of some crime.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I. I know why. Because you&#8217;re shut up
here like a dormouse when you&#8217;ve lived like a lark.
On with your little red Tam and come with me. Our
work is getting on famously, famously. If I could
get hold of one person that I&#8217;ve hunted this and every
other city near for I&#8217;d have the matter in a nut shell
and the guilty man in&#8211;a prison. I&#8217;ve found&#8211;three
or four more of those links I mentioned, Hale, and
every man of them is another witness to the uprightness
of one, Cassius Trent, late of Sobrante. I began
this job for little Jess, but I confess I&#8217;m finishing it
for the sake of a man I never saw. He was a trump,
that fellow. One of the great-hearted, impracticable
creatures that keep my faith in humanity. If we could
only find that Antonio!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. <i>If!</i> But when he rode away from Sobrante
that day he seems to have ridden out of the world, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
far as any trace he left behind. I&#8217;m getting discouraged,
for without him all the rest falls to the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, discouraged? We&#8217;ll just step out and find
him, won&#8217;t we, Lady Jess?&#8221;</p>

<p>She had hastened to ask permission to go out with
her friend and had come back radiant, now, at prospect
even of so brief an outing. It was quite as the reporter
had judged; the close confinement of the hospital,
after the out-of-door life at Sobrante, was half the
cause of Jessica&#8217;s depression, and she was ready now
to fall in with the gay mood of Ninian Sharp and answered,
promptly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. We&#8217;ll find &#8216;him,&#8217; since you wish it. But
I don&#8217;t happen to know which &#8216;him&#8217; you want?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, our fine Senor Bernal. Who else?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let us go to the old Spanish quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been, many times. Sent others also. No. He&#8217;s
a wise chap and if he is in this town frequents no
haunt where he&#8217;ll be looked for so surely. No matter.
It&#8217;s a picturesque corner of the town and maybe a
sight of some old adobes would do your homesick eyes
good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Or harm,&#8221; suggested Mr. Hale.</p>

<p>But they did not stop to hear his objections and were
speedily on the car which would take them nearest to
the district Jessica had heard of, both from Antonio at
home and now from others here. A relic of the old
California, whose history she loved to hear from the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
lips of Pedro, Fra Mateo, or even &#8220;Forty-niner&#8221; himself.</p>

<p>But once arrived there she was disappointed. They
were old adobes, true enough, and the people who lived
in them had the same dark, Spanish cast of face which
she remembered of Antonio. Yet there the resemblance
ended. This was the home of squalor, of poverty that
was not self-respecting enough to be clean, and of an
indolence which had brought about a wretched state of
affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! is this it? But it can&#8217;t be. Antonio&#8217;s &#8216;quarter&#8217;
was a splendid place. The old grandees lived there,
keeping up a sort of court and all the customs of a
hundred years ago. It was &#8216;a picture, a romance, a
dream,&#8217; he said. Of an evening he would describe it all
to us at home till I felt as if it were the one spot in
the world I most wished to see. But&#8211;<i>this!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn not up your pretty nose, for &#8216;<i>this</i>,&#8217; my dear
little unenlightened maiden, is also a dream&#8211;a nightmare.
Nevertheless, the very ground your lost hero
boasted and embellished with his fancy. The more I
hear of this versatile Antonio the greater becomes my
longing to behold him. In any case, since we&#8217;re here,
we must not go away without entering some of these
shops. You shall buy a trinket or two and present one
of them as a keepsake to this fine senor, when you find
him. Oh! that I had your familiar knowledge of his
features, this absent &#8216;grandee,&#8217; that if by accident I met
him I might know him on the instant. See. This
&#8216;bazaar&#8217; is somewhat tidier than its neighbors, as well
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
as larger, and there are some really beautiful Navajo
blankets in the window. Unfortunately the pocketbook
of a reporter isn&#8217;t quite equal to more than a dozen of
these, at fifty dollars apiece. Something more modest,
Lady Jess, and I&#8217;ll oblige you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up to protest and saw that he was teasing,
and exclaimed, with an air of mock injury:</p>

<p>&#8220;Those or nothing! But when shall I learn to understand
your jest from earnest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you produce me your Antonio!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon the instant, then,&#8221; she retorted, gayly.</p>

<p>Upon the instant, indeed, there were hurrying footsteps
behind them, the sound of some one breathing
rapidly and of angrily muttered sentences, that were a
jumble of Spanish and English, and in a voice which
made Jessica Trent start and turn aside, clutching her
companion&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>He turned, also, throwing his arm about her shoulders,
lest the rush of the man approaching should force
her from the narrow sidewalk. But she darted from
him, straight into the path of this wild-looking person
and seized him with both hands, while she cried out:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s he! It is Antonio! I&#8217;ve found him&#8211;Antonio
Bernal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew! A case of the &#8216;unexpected,&#8217; indeed! The
merest jest and the absolute fact. Hi! I&#8217;d rather this
than&#8211;than be struck by lightning, and it&#8217;s on about
the same order of things, for it is he, as she claimed.
He&#8217;s more staggered than I am,&#8221; considered this lively
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span>
newspaper man. Then he thought it time to step forward,
and remark:</p>

<p>&#8220;Please present me to your friend, Miss Trent,&#8221;
and lifted his hat, courteously.</p>

<p>Antonio bowed, after his own exaggerated fashion,
and with his hand upon his heart; but though his eyes
rested keenly on Ninian&#8217;s face he kept tight hold of
Jessica&#8217;s hand and his torrent of words did not cease
for an instant. Now and then he lifted the little hand
and kissed it, whereupon Lady Jess would snatch it
away and coolly wipe it on her skirt, only to have it
recaptured and caressed; till, seeing he would neither
give over the hateful action nor stop talking, she folded
her arms behind her and interrupted with:</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough, Senor Bernal. This isn&#8217;t Sobrante,
but I&#8217;m your captain here, same as there. You come
tell your story to Mr. Hale and this gentleman. See
Ephraim Marsh, too. He&#8217;s here in hospital with a
broken leg. I&#8217;m in Los Angeles, also, as you see; and
likely to find the same man you say has cheated you.
That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s telling, Mr. Sharp,&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Antonio hesitated. He had frowned at her tone of
command, but now, to the reporter&#8217;s amazement,
seemed eager to obey it.</p>

<p>&#8220;As the senorita will. That gentleman, who came
last to Sobrante, was one lawyer, no? So the senora
said. Fool! fool! that I was that I did not then and at
that moment so disclose the secrets of my heart as was
moved, yes. Let the senorita and the handsome friend
lead on. I follow. I, Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>Five minutes earlier, had Ninian Sharp been asked
what he should do if he did find this strange person,
he would have promptly answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Put him under lock and key, where he can do no
harm and be handy to get at.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now he found himself as certain that the fellow
needed no restraint of the law, at present. That he
was dreadfully unhappy and had become as humble as
he had before been arrogant. What could so have
altered him? And was it thus that the Lady Jess had
all her &#8220;boys&#8221; in leading strings?</p>

<p>&#8220;I must look out for myself or I&#8217;ll fall under a like
spell,&#8221; he laughed, as with the air of one who knows
it all, though she had been over that way but once,
Jessica explained to her late manager:</p>

<p>&#8220;This car will take us straight back to the hospital.
We&#8217;ve not been away long and I think Mr. Hale will
still be there. He&#8217;ll be glad to see you. <i>Very glad.</i> He
and Mr. Sharp have been looking for you. I think you
can tell them something they&#8217;re anxious to know. Ephraim
is there, anyhow. He, poor fellow, can&#8217;t go away,
even if he wishes&#8211;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hale was still in &#8220;Forty-niner&#8217;s&#8221; room and
recognized Antonio with such an outburst of surprise
that Ephraim opened his eyes, for he had been dozing,
and fixed them on the newcomer, inquiringly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What! You, you snake! <i>you here?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But certainly, yes. I, I, Antonio, at your service.
Hast the broken leer? This is bad. Old bones are slow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
to heal. You will not shoot again at dear Sobrante,
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t? Well, I rather guess it&#8217;ll take somebody
stronger &#8217;n you to stop it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Antonio shrugged his shoulders in a manner deemed
offensive by the patient, who struggled to rise, but was
prevented by Jessica&#8217;s quick movement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim! Antonio! Don&#8217;t quarrel, this very first
minute. One of you is sick and the other half frantic
with some trouble. Please, Antonio, go away now with
Mr. Hale and Mr. Sharp. One must never make a noise
in a hospital,&#8221; said this wise maiden of eleven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! so? But it is the lawyer I want, yet. The lawyer
who will make a villain return the great money I
have given. <i>Caramba!</i> If I had him in my hands this
minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica lifted a warning finger and the manager lowered
his voice. He even made an attempt at soothing
Ephraim, but chose an unfortunate argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take peace to yourself, &#8216;Forty-niner.&#8217; All must be
told some day. <i>Adios.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Adios</i>, you foreign serpent! Old? Old! he calls
me&#8211;me&#8211;old! Why, I&#8217;m a babe in arms to Pedro, or
Fra Mateo, or even fat Brigida, who washes for us
&#8216;boys.&#8217; Old! A man but just turned eighty! Snake,
I&#8217;ll outlive you yet. I&#8217;ll get well, to spite you; and I&#8217;ll
be on hand, when they let you out the lockup, to give
you the neatest horsewhippin&#8217; you ever see. Old! Get
out!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>Fearful of further excitement, the gentlemen hurried
Antonio away, yet kept a keen watch upon his
movements for, at that word &#8220;lockup,&#8221; the man&#8217;s dark
face had turned to an ashen hue.</p>

<p>As they left the hospital the every-busy ambulance
rolled past them toward the accident ward. The others
averted their eyes, but the Spaniard peered curiously
within, and, instantly a shuddering groan burst from
his lips. Inside that van lay the solution to all their
difficulties; though Antonio alone had comprehended it.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span><a id='link_18'></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>APPREHENDED</span></h2>

<p>The pleasantest task which fell to Jessica&#8217;s hands,
during her hospital life, was the distributing of flowers
and fruits, almost daily sent by the charitable for the
comfort of the patients.</p>

<p>The nurses received and apportioned these gifts; and,
carrying her big, tray-like basket, Lady Jess visited
each ward and room in turn, adding to the pretty offering
some bright word of her own. For she now had
the freedom of the house and knew the occupant of
each white bed better, even, than his or her attendant
nurse. The quiet manner which she had gained here,
her ready help and loving sympathy, made her coming
looked for eagerly; but the happiness she thus bestowed
was more than returned upon her own heart. Could
her &#8220;boys&#8221; have seen her they would have been proud,
but not surprised, for to the appreciative words his
own attendant gave his darling, Ephraim would instantly
reply?</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Course. What else could you expect? Didn&#8217;t she
have the finest man in the world for her father? and
isn&#8217;t her mother a lady? Isn&#8217;t she, herself, the sweetest,
lovingest, most unselfish child that ever lived?
But it&#8217;ll be meat to feed the &#8216;boys&#8217; with, all these stories
you&#8217;re telling me. They most worship her now, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
after they listen to such talk a spell&#8211;h-m-m. The
whole secret is just&#8211;love. That&#8217;s what our captain
is made of; pure love. &#8217;Twas a good thing for this old
earth when she was born.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll spoil her among you, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t. Little Jessica Trent can&#8217;t be
spoiled. &#8217;Cause them same &#8216;boys&#8217; would be the first
ones to take any nonsense out of her, at the first symptoms.
She couldn&#8217;t stand ridicule. It would break her
heart; but they&#8217;d give her ridicule and plenty of it if
she put on silly airs. You needn&#8217;t be afraid for Lady
Jess.&#8221;</p>

<p>On that very day, after Antonio had left the hospital
with his friends, or captors, as the case might prove.
Jessica went through the building with her tray of
roses, and in the wing adjoining the accident ward
saw a man lying in one of the hitherto empty rooms.</p>

<p>&#8220;A new patient. He must have been brought in
to-day. I&#8217;ve never been to the new ones till I was
told, but I hate to pass him by. I wonder if it would
be wrong to ask him if he wished a flower! And how
still he stays. Yet his eyes are very wide open and so
round! He looks like somebody I&#8217;ve seen&#8211;why, little
Luis Garcia! &#8217;Tis Luis himself, grown old and thin.
For Luis&#8217; sake, then I&#8217;ll try.&#8221;</p>

<p>A nurse was sitting silent at the patient&#8217;s bedside
and toward her the child turned an inquiring glance.
The answer was a slight, affirmative nod. The attendant&#8217;s
thought was that it would please Lady Jess
to give the rose and could do the patient no harm to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
receive it. Indeed, nothing earthly could harm him any
more.</p>

<p>So Jessica stepped softly in and paused beside the
cot. Her face was full of pity and of a growing astonishment,
for the nearer she beheld it the more startling
was the sick man&#8217;s likeness to a childish face hundreds
of miles away.</p>

<p>Her stare brought the patient&#8217;s own vacant gaze back
to a consciousness of things about him. He saw a
yellow-haired girl looking curiously upon him and extending
toward him a half-blown rose. A fair and unexpected
vision in that place of pain, and he asked,
half querulously:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are you? An angel come to upbraid me before
my time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Jessica Trent, of Sobrante ranch, in Paraiso
d&#8217;Oro valley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;W-h-a-t!&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse bent forward, but he motioned her aside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say that again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just little Jessica Trent. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All! Trent&#8211;Trent. Ah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you? Are you Luis Garcia&#8217;s missing father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Luis&#8211;Luis Garcia. Was it Luis, Ysandra called
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. That was the name on the paper my
father found pinned to the baby&#8217;s dress. The letter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
told that the baby&#8217;s father had gone away promising to
come back, but had never come. The mother had heard
of my dear father&#8217;s goodness to all who needed help,
and she was on her way to him when her strength gave
out. So she died there in the canyon, and she said the
baby&#8217;s name was like the father&#8217;s. I remember it all,
because to us the &#8216;Maria&#8217; seems like a girl&#8217;s name, too.
Luis Maria Manuel Alessandro Garcia.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man&#8217;s round eyes opened wider and wider. It
seemed as if his glare pierced the child&#8217;s very heart,
and she drew back frightened. The nurse motioned
her to go, but at her first movement toward the door
the patient extended his hands imploring:</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Not yet. My time is spent. Let me hear all&#8211;all. The child your father found&#8211;ah! me! Your
father of all men! Did&#8211;did it live?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it lived. He is a darling little fellow
and he looks&#8211;he looks so like you that I knew you in
a moment. He has the same wide brown eyes, the same
black curls, his eyebrows slant so, like yours, he is
your image. But he is the cutest little chap you ever
saw. He is my own brother&#8217;s age and they have grown
up together, like twins, I guess. It would break Ned&#8217;s
heart to have you take him away from us. You won&#8217;t
now, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>A pitiful smile spread over the pain-racked features,
and the man glanced significantly toward the nurse.
She smiled encouragingly upon him, but he was not
misled. After a moment of silence, during which
Jessica anxiously watched his drawn face, he spoke.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span>&#8220;Go, child. Your mission is done. Send a lawyer,
quick. Quick. The man I wronged&#8211;the savior of my
son! A lawyer, quick. Bring the suit case&#8211;the case!
Let none open it but the child. Quick. Quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>Higher authority even than her own convinced the
nurse that obedience to his urgency was the only way
now to allay the patient&#8217;s rising excitement. The accident
which had crushed the lower part of his body, so
that his life was but a question of hours, had left his
head clear for the present; and here, indeed, seemed a
case for more than surgical treatment.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the needed &#8220;lawyer&#8221; was close at hand,
waiting with the reporter and the half-distraught Antonio
whose shriek of recognition had been Luis Garcia&#8217;s
welcome to the hospital. Unceasingly, the manager
had declared that this was the man all three of
them were seeking; had insisted upon returning to the
ante-room of the hospital, and avowed that he would
never leave the spot until the &#8220;villain&#8221; had been apprehended.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has misled and cheated me. I, Antonio! He
has all my money. He has the savings of my life, yes.
He has all that I did not yet pay, of the crops so good,
to the Senora Trent. More, more. That money&#8211;which,
ah, me! He told me, yes, a thousand million
times, that I, and not that New York company, to me
alone was the inheritance of Paraiso d&#8217;Oro. My money
was to prove it, that inheritance, yes. To me was the
power of attorney, was it not? of Cassius Trent, who
was the so good man and the so poor fool at business.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>&#8220;Look out, there, neighbor! Speaking of fools and
business, you don&#8217;t appear to have been so brilliant
yourself,&#8221; corrected Ninian, promptly.</p>

<p>Antonio continued, heedless of the interruption:</p>

<p>&#8220;He was the great banker, Garcia, no? What then?
Who would so safe keep the money from that far New
York? With the master&#8217;s wish I gave it to that bank.
And the letters&#8211;<i>Caramba!</i> So high, to one&#8217;s knees, to
one&#8217;s waist I pile them, the letters! All wrote of his
own hand. All say by-and-by, <i>manana</i>, he give me the
perfect title and send back that which belongs, after
all expenses, no? To them in New York.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A pretty scheme. You don&#8217;t seem to have profited
by it greatly, as yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, profit? But I am now the beggar, I, poor Antonio.
This day I come from resting in the houses of
my friends and I find&#8211;what do I find? The bank is
not. The banker is not, yes. His house where he
lived more plain than our adobes at Sobrante, that
house is closed. His man tell me this: &#8216;He has gone
away. One little, little trip, a journey. Across the
sea. He will come back. Have patience, Antonio.&#8217;
But my money? my papers? my inheritance so all but
proved? Tush. He told me not that. &#8216;When he comes
back you can ask him, himself.&#8217; So. Good. He has
come back. Here. I see him, sure. I<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>A summons to Mr. Hale cut short this fierce harangue,
which had been repeated till their ears were
tired.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>The banker had come back, indeed, poor creature.
By the very train on which he was to depart with his
plunder&#8211;all rendered into the solid cash which would
tell no tales, as he fancied&#8211;by this swift-moving juggernaut
he was overtaken and crushed down. A moment
earlier he would have been in time. But in haste
and by a misstep he had ended all his earthly journeyings.</p>

<p>When the lawyer was called the reporter followed
his friend and Antonio followed him, and when these
three approached the little room in which the dying
man lay, the nurse would have sent them back; but
Garcia himself pleaded: &#8220;Let them be. What matters
it how many hear or see? The dress-suit case. Bring
it, and bring the child.&#8221;</p>

<p>They obeyed and he bade them place the key in
Jessica&#8217;s small hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open it, little one.&#8221;</p>

<p>But her fingers shook so that the nurse, in pity,
pushed them from the lock and herself unfastened the
heavily laden case. It contained no clothing, such as
might have been looked for within; but rolls and packets
neatly tied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open them, child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! please! I do not want to; I am afraid!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid, Jessica Trent? Do you not yet understand?
That is money, money&#8211;of which your father stood
accused before the world as having stolen. Afraid to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
prove your father what you know him&#8211;an honest
man!&#8221; cried Ninian in anger.</p>

<p>She understood him then, and in frantic haste
obeyed. Roll after roll, till Mr. Hale said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Enough. His strength is failing. This scene is
too much for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that she pushed the gold away and, falling on
her knees beside the bed, caught Luis Garcia&#8217;s hand
and covered it with kisses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! thank you, Luis&#8217; father! God bless you, God
take care of you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! the divine pity of childhood,&#8221; murmured
Ninian, huskily. &#8220;She forgets that it was he who
wronged her in the fact that he has now set her right.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sick man&#8217;s face brightened, nor did he withdraw
his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>You forgive me?</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The little Luis. The son I never saw. What shall
you tell him of his father?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That he was good to me, and that he suffered.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More. Tell the boy this: I never knew he lived. I
should have known, I should have searched. I did not.
Ask him, too, to forgive me. And because of me, turn
him not away.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse motioned all the others to go out, and they
went, Ninian Sharp himself standing guard over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
dress-suit case the attendant had relocked until it was
once more safely deposited in the strong box of the
hospital, where even Antonio&#8217;s greedy eyes could see
it no longer.</p>

<p>But Jessica knelt on, awed and silent, yet now quite
unafraid. And Luis Garcia still clasped her hand and
fixed his fading gaze upon her pitying face.</p>

<p>&#8220;The mother&#8211;Ysandra. Where lies she now?
Little one, do you know that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I not? In the consecrated ground of the old
mission itself. With all the good dead priests sleeping
about her. Rose vines cover her grave and my own
mother tends them herself. Little Luis is made to
water it, sometimes, though, for that is a good way to
keep her memory green, my mother says. Near by is
where my father rests. Would&#8211;would you wish to
sleep there, too, beside them both, and where Luis
could bring flowers to you as to her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I may? You&#8211;are&#8211;willing? Would&#8211;your mother&#8211;so kind&#8211;little Luis<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother pities and helps all who suffer. You
suffer, poor man, and I wish that she were here to tell
you &#8216;yes&#8217; herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he had closed his eyes and she could not know
if he had heard her, though she was glad to see that
the look of pain had almost left his features. She did
not speak again but sat quite still until, at last, her hand
grew numb and she turned toward the nurse, whispering:</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>&#8220;Can I move it? Will it disturb him? He seems to
be asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>The nurse bent over her patient, then gently answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, darling. Your task is over. Nothing will ever
trouble him again. He is at peace&#8211;<i>asleep</i>.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span><a id='link_19'></a>CHAPTER XIX<br /><span class='h2fs'>ANTONIO&#8217;S MESSAGE</span></h2>

<p>Jessica went back to Ephraim&#8217;s room, to tell him
this wonderful ending of their once almost hopeless
search, and for long they discussed the story that was
at once so strange, so moving, and yet so simple.</p>

<p>&#8220;Man proposes, God disposes,&#8221; quoted &#8220;Forty-niner,&#8221;
with all the emphasis of an original philosophy.
&#8220;If we&#8217;d set out to make up a fairy story we couldn&#8217;t
have beat this. But I&#8217;m so glad, it seems like I could
get right up and dance a jig, smashed leg and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad! Ephraim, I&#8217;m so glad, too, and the gladness
is so deep, deep down that I don&#8217;t want to dance. I
just want to cry. And that poor man is little Luis&#8217;
father. Oh! it is pitiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, captain. Don&#8217;t you go to grieving over that
scamp. A man don&#8217;t get good nor bad all in a minute.
It was hard enough, I &#8217;low, for a fellow to be snatched
out of the world that sudden. Yet, if he could speak
for himself, he&#8217;d say a thousand times better that than
what the law would have given him. Let him be. His
part is done. He&#8217;s passed in his checks and don&#8217;t you
hear that Heaven won&#8217;t pay out on all the good ones.
Now&#8211;what next?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>Both knew, yet both disliked to mention that which
each felt. Till Ephraim swallowed something like a
sob and remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;The longer I lie here, like a log, the madder I get
at myself and the weaker minded. I&#8217;m just about as
ready to cry as a whipped baby. I know &#8217;twas the best
thing could have happened, my getting hurt, though
why a plain, everyday break wouldn&#8217;t have answered
the purpose just as well as this &#8216;compound fracture,&#8217;
the doctors make such a fuss over and takes so long to
heal, I don&#8217;t see. Nor never shall. If it had been just
ordinary bone-crackin&#8217; I&#8217;d been lively as a hop-toad by
now, and ready to start right home with you this minute.
As it is<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Ephraim! I hate to leave you&#8211;but I must get
quickly to my mother! Don&#8217;t you see I must? To
smooth all those sad lines out of her dear face and make
her happy again, as this news surely will. They&#8217;ll be
good to you here, and you can come the first minute
they&#8217;ll let you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not telegraph her? The boys go every day to
Marion for the letters you and all send, and the postmaster
is the operator, too. Why not that, and wait
just a day or two. Likely I&#8217;ll be cavortin&#8217; round, supple
as a lizard on a fence, by then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica did not answer and Ephraim asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;How could you go, anyway, without me or some
protector? Though I made a bad job of it once I
wouldn&#8217;t the second time.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how, dear old fellow, and I do know
how bitter disappointed you are that you can&#8217;t be there
to see my mother&#8217;s face and get her thanks right away.
But<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Fortunately for both of these perplexed people,
Ninian Sharp came along the passage just then, and
one glimpse of his bright, helpful face cleared away
Jessica&#8217;s anxieties.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll know what&#8217;s best and how to do it, won&#8217;t
you, dear Mr. Sharp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly. That&#8217;s my business. Straightening out
the tangled affairs of the silly rest of the world! Fetch
on your trouble!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was in the gayest of moods, elated over the successful
termination of his tedious labors, though in his
heart not unmindful of the tragedy which had brought
his share in them to an end. What was left, the law&#8217;s
dealings with Antonio and the division and disposition
of the recovered funds, belonged to Mr. Hale, and he
very thankfully resigned these matters to that gentleman&#8217;s
capable hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go home. And I don&#8217;t want to leave
Ephraim.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to go with you. And I&#8217;m going to leave
Ephraim&#8211;because he&#8217;d have to stay awhile, whether or
not. He will be an important witness for the prosecution,
providing that New York Company bothers any
further after having recovered all that belongs to them,
with some that doesn&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve a &#8216;loose foot,&#8217; as I&#8217;ve heard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span>
that your &#8216;Aunt Sally&#8217; also has betimes, and I mean
to shake it out Sobrante way. If you&#8217;d like to travel
in my company I can&#8217;t prevent it, as I see!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! you darling man! You mean&#8211;I know it, for
it&#8217;s just like all the rest of your great kindness&#8211;that
you&#8217;re going wholly on purpose to take me home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, but indeed, I&#8217;m not. At this present
moment I have no stronger desire than to see that
wonderful ranch of yours and those &#8216;boys&#8217; who&#8217;ve
spoiled you so. Why, I couldn&#8217;t stay away, after putting
my finger so deeply into your family pie. I propose
to start on the nine o&#8217;clock train to-morrow morning.
Think you can be ready by then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready this minute! No, I mean, as soon as I
bid everybody good-by, and&#8211;and<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do a little shopping, eh? That&#8217;s what most young
ladies delay for, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m neither a young lady nor have I any shopping
to do. I couldn&#8217;t have because I haven&#8217;t any
money, you see, even if I knew how to shop.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; demanded &#8220;Forty-niner,&#8221; impatiently. &#8220;No
money? I don&#8217;t believe all ours is gone yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I forgot that. I really did. And I would
love, if Mr. Sharp thinks it would be all right to use
it when there is all this hospital board for both of us
to pay, to take a tiny bit of a present to&#8211;to<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody you ever knew, I&#8217;ll be bound!&#8221; cried
Ninian.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>&#8220;I&#8211;believe I would. But of course I can&#8217;t. So
I&#8217;d best treat all alike and take nothing but our glorious
goods news.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take that myself, part of the way.
At the finish I&#8217;ll let you carry the heavy burden and
deliver it yourself into your mother&#8217;s hands. Now,
come sit down a minute. Ephraim, put on your own
thinking cap, and if she forgets anybody you let me
know. We are going to take something to everybody,
just as you&#8217;d like. Now, begin. The mother&#8211;but
she&#8217;s settled, already. For her I&#8217;ve made a finished
picture from a sketch I have, of a little yellow-haired
girl asleep upon a piebald burro&#8217;s shoulder. Ned?
A train of cars. Luis, ditto. Samson&#8211;what for Samson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would it cost too much to take them each, all
the &#8216;boys&#8217; the same thing, and that would be a bright
red necktie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cost not a bit too much and be a deal easier than
thinking of separate things for so many. Next?
Aunt Sally?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! she&#8217;s no trouble. A few bits of new calico
&#8216;print&#8217; for her patchwork would make her very happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>They forgot nobody, not even Ferd whom Jessica
so disliked; and at the end of the list she rather timidly
suggested: &#8220;Antonio.&#8221;</p>

<p>To that, however, both her friends cried a vehement
&#8220;No!&#8221; Not a cent of their money should ever
go to please such a man as the Senor Bernal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>&#8220;But, that reminds me. This Antonio himself wishes
to have an interview with you before you leave Los
Angeles. I want you, though, to feel at liberty to
refuse this request if you so desire. He deserves no
kindness at your hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Don&#8217;t you go near him, captain. He&#8217;s a
snake and snakes are unpleasant critters even after
their fangs are drawn. Leave Antonio to me. When
I get well I&#8217;ll have a little score to settle with him
on my own behalf,&#8221; urged Ephraim.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he come to me, himself? Instead of
sending for me to him. Then I shouldn&#8217;t have to
trouble you to take me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Sharp looked at Ephraim and smiled, significantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose because he cannot. Else so polished a
gentleman would surely do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why cannot he? Is he ill, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Rather ill in his mind, but not in body. Simply,
he isn&#8217;t allowed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t the hospital folks have him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at present.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you are teasing me. Where is Antonio?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At police headquarters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! with Matron Wood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with that good woman, I fear.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>&#8220;Mr. Sharp, please, <i>don&#8217;t</i> tease me any more. What
do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Antonio is under restraint of the law. He is a
prisoner, for the present. Detained until Mr. Hale
can consult with his New York people and find out
their disposition toward the fellow. He has done
criminal things without, apparently, any benefit to
himself. He says there is something on his mind
that he must tell you. We&#8217;ll call to see him on our
way to the shopping district and get him over and
done with. I&#8217;ve no desire to continue his acquaintance,
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica&#8217;s face grew serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! poor Antonio!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quit that!&#8221; commanded &#8220;Forty-niner,&#8221; with more
sharpness than he often used toward his beloved lady.</p>

<p>&#8220;But, it is so terrible to be a&#8211;prisoner. That
means that one can never go out into the fields or
climb the mountains, or ride, or hunt, or anything one
likes. He has done dreadful wrongs, and I never
used to like him as well as I ought, but now I&#8217;m sorry
for him. I can&#8217;t help it, Ephraim, even if it does displease
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H-m-m. He brought his own misfortunes upon
himself. But first he had brought worse ones on his
truest friends and innocent persons whom he never
saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he didn&#8217;t know any better. Maybe<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>&#8220;Child, you are incorrigible. You&#8217;d pity&#8211;anybody.
Yet, perhaps, you are right in a measure. Antonio
strikes me as more fool that knave.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be glad to say good-by to him, anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a greatly altered Antonio they found. All
his haughtiness was gone and his depression, his fear,
was so abject that while Lady Jess pitied him even
more than before, the reporter felt only contempt.
It was he who cut short the manager&#8217;s wordy explanations
and commanded:</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, if you&#8217;ve got anything special to say to Miss
Trent, out with it and have done. We must be off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then leave her alone with me for five minutes,
yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. What you can say to her must be said in my
presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jessica petitioned for the favor, and Ninian
stepped into an adjoining room, leaving the door ajar.</p>

<p>As soon as he was out of sight, Senor Bernal leaned
forward, clasping his hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the good turn I do. Well, then, it is the
good turn you will answer, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;d do you any &#8216;good turn&#8217; which was
right for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then plead for me, my liberty. It is you, senorita,
who have the so great, the strange power to move
many hearts to your will. <i>Si.</i> You will plead, then,
if I tell you&#8211;something&#8211;a little story&#8211;maybe?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>&#8220;I&#8217;m in no mood for stories, and you&#8217;re talking in
riddles as you&#8217;ve always been fond of doing. Say
what you mean at once, Antonio, for I&#8217;m going home
to-morrow. Home! going home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! me! And? But yes. I will. I will force
myself. I will ask it. That&#8211;that&#8211;title? Know
you of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How should I know?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ephraim. Was not Ephraim at the safe one midnight?
Is not Ephraim a little strange&#8211;here?&#8221; touching
his own forehead.</p>

<p>Jessica turned away, indignant.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but you are. The queerest, crookedest man I
ever saw. If you&#8217;ve anything to tell me, just be quick,
I am going. As for Ephraim, I wish, unhappy man,
that you had half the goodness and honesty in your
whole body that dear old fellow has in his littlest
finger. He couldn&#8217;t do a mean thing nor even think
one, and if you sent for me to abuse him to me you
might have spared yourself the trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then. It is known, is it not? That when I
shook the dust of Sobrante rancho from my feet I
took away with me all the papers that appertained to
the so great business of the place? Why not? Was I
not to go back the master, and for the settlement of
all affairs which I had with the Dona Gabriella?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will please never call my mother by her first
name again, Antonio Bernal. She is an American
gentlewoman, and her title is Mrs. Trent. Understand?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
She is not afraid of you, nor am I, though
she was patient and, for her children&#8217;s sakes, would not
quarrel nor resent your insolence. All that is changed.
You can do us no further harm. My father&#8217;s name is
freed from all the shadow that your wickedness cast
over it, and as for titles to property&#8211;poor! None
of the Trents, big or little, care anything for property
since we have regained honor! Besides, Sobrante
isn&#8217;t the only home in the world. They are everywhere,
waiting for those who will take them. If we
lose Sobrante, as I suppose we may, I&#8211;just I, Jessica
Trent, a child, will make a home for my mother and
my brother&#8211;somewhere. I am strong. I can work.
I am not at all afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite his meanness and cupidity, Antonio was
moved. The girl was radiant in her courage and enthusiasm,
and her disdain of what he could make her
suffer was infinite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good, senorita. When you speak and look like
that I can no longer keep silence, I. The papers! It
is possible, no? That among them, in my so great
haste at leaving Sobrante, that little, yes, it might&#8211;it
might be among those other papers appertaining to the
so great business. <i>Si.</i> If I point the way, if I tell
the secret retiring place of me, I, Antonio Bernal, you
will plead and set me free? It is a contract, a bargain&#8211;yes?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica pondered. The temptation was strong to
say &#8220;yes&#8221; without delay; but she had now learned to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
distrust the late manager of her mother&#8217;s business, and
answered, cautiously:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can, Antonio, but if my mother forbids
me to &#8216;plead,&#8217; I shall not disobey her. You did
what you pleased, and my friends say you will have to
suffer the consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but it is the so old head on the so small
shoulders. That wisdom was not of your own, senorita.
But, I forgive the suspicion. Yes, I am magnanimous.
I am generous, I, Senor Bernal, heir&#8211;rightful
heir&#8211;to Sobrante rancho and all of Paraiso d&#8217;Oro.
See! Behold! Did the Lady Jessica never hear of El
Desierto, no?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Deserted Ranch? Where Pedro says the
spirits of dead people walk? Of course. Everybody
has heard of that. Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sometimes the &#8216;spirits&#8217; keep hidden treasures safe.
Yes. <i>Si.</i> Does the senorita know the trail thither,
to that haunted place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Nor wish to. Good-by, Antonio. I can wait
for no more of your nonsense.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The paper. The pencil, which the Lady Jess holds
in her hand. One moment, that to me, if the senorita
pleases.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I brought these for my little shopping trip, which
I&#8217;m to take with Mr. Sharp. I can&#8217;t give them to you,
but I&#8217;ll lend, for a moment. Here they are. Be quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Antonio seized the pencil and rapidly sketched upon
the pad a few dots and lines, suggesting a zigzag
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span>
road and stations upon it. At the starting point he
wrote &#8220;Marion,&#8221; and at the end &#8220;Sobrante.&#8221; Midway,
and well to the north, where a curving course indicated
an arroyo he marked &#8220;El Desierto.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he looked up, and Jessica reached forward to
take back her possessions.</p>

<p>But with what he considered great chaft and cunning
he thrust them behind him and smiled grimly:</p>

<p>&#8220;The promise, senorita. First the promise; &#8216;I will
plead for the liberty of Senor Antonio Bernal, so
help me<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Unperceived by the artful manager, Ninian Sharp
had entered the room from a rear door. He was tired
of waiting for the interview to end and had overheard
most of it from the outer room. He now quietly
stretched out his own hand and possessed himself of
the rude map, and then as quietly and instantly withdrew
with it, calling as he did so:</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Lady Jess. Time&#8217;s up. So is Antonio&#8217;s
little game; yet, thanks, senor, for playing it so openly,
Good-day. <i>Adios.</i> Farewell. <i>Et cetera. Au revoir</i>
and all the rest. We&#8217;ll show you that title deed&#8211;if
we find it!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span><a id='link_20'></a>CHAPTER XX<br /><span class='h2fs'>A RAILWAY JOURNEY</span></h2>

<p>The morning of departure had come and, trembling
with both fear and eagerness, Jessica stood beside the
reporter upon the station, waiting for the great train
to move outward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Step aboard, Lady Jess. Homeward bound!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! it looks so big and somehow dreadful. I can
ride any kind of a horse, or an ostrich, and burros, of
course, but<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t know yet how to ride a railway carriage.
Then let me tell you you&#8217;ll find it so delightful
you&#8217;ll not want to get out when the journey&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe that, Mr. Sharp. The end of
the journey, this part, at least, means, Marion, and
that&#8217;s but a bit of a way from my mother. Is everything
ready? Scruff? Is he here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come and see the sorrowful chap in his moving
stable if you wish. Though it hasn&#8217;t moved as yet.
He&#8217;ll probably rebel against the state of affairs, at
first; then be just as unwilling to leave the car as he
was to enter it. It&#8217;s a fine place for sleeping, and
sleeping is Scruff&#8217;s chief aim in life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s had to make up for lost time, for he&#8217;d never
too much sleep at home, where Ned and Luis were.
Oh! to think! To-morrow, to-morrow&#8211;this very next
day that&#8217;s coming&#8211;I shall have my arms around those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
children&#8217;s precious necks and feel my mother&#8217;s kisses
on my lips. I can&#8217;t wait. I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! I shall begin to think you can wait and
very contentedly if you don&#8217;t step into this car pretty
soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica had never traveled by rail and the shock
of the accident which had befallen Luis&#8217; father made
her more timid than she had ever been before. She
had pleaded to make the return trip by saddle, as she
had come, but Mr. Sharp would not consent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Time. Time. We must make time, Lady Jess.
A newspaper man never uses a week where a day
will do. If he did&#8211;well, no knowing if we should ever
get out a single issue of <i>The Lancet</i>. Come on. If
there were any danger do you think I would make you
face it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus shamed and by the friend who had proved so
true to her interests, the little girl shut her eyes, held
out her hands and was lightly swung upon the rear
platform of the luxurious coach in which they were to
make the first half of their trip. Later, they would
have to leave the main line for a branch road, terminating
at Marion, their postal station. From Marion,
the thirty miles of saddle work, with the added detour
on account of El Desierto, would be all the reporter
fancied he should care for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some day I&#8217;ll come back to Sobrante, if I&#8217;m invited,
and get that famous rider, Samson, to teach me
the trick of &#8216;broncho busting&#8217; or some other caper.
But now, the engine can&#8217;t travel fast enough to suit
my impatience.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>Nor Jessica, neither, after the first few moments of
the journey. She forgot her fear in watching the
swiftly moving landscape, and found it hard to believe
that the landscape itself was still and she who
was carried past it. This time there was none of Aunt
Sally&#8217;s bountiful luncheon but what seemed to Lady
Jess something far finer&#8211;a dining car. To be sure,
during their first meal in this, served by colored waiters
whose unfamiliar faces distracted her attention,
and swayed by the motion of the train, the girl&#8217;s appetite
was not worth mentioning; but by the time the
supper hour was reached she was ready to enjoy almost
everything which her companion ordered for her. It
delighted him to observe how swiftly she comprehended
and adapted herself to new things, and in his
spirit of &#8220;teasing&#8221; he laid several harmless &#8220;traps&#8221;
for her entanglement.</p>

<p>But she had now learned to distinguish his fun from
his earnest and, after one keen glance into his face,
would skillfully avoid the little slips of speech or manner
that would have so diverted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Mr. Sharp, I&#8217;m ever so ignorant of the way
city people and traveling people do, but one thing
Ephraim taught me, even on our quiet way out. That
was: &#8216;Use your eyes, not your tongue, and watch
what other folks do.&#8217; So, if watching will prevent
my doing awkward things, I&#8217;ll watch, surely enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were to sleep at Marion, and when they finally
left the less comfortable car of the branch road at
that town, it was very dark and no vehicles were in
waiting to convey passengers to the one hotel of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
place. Few persons stopped at Marion, except such
as resided there or near, and such either walked from
the station to their homes or had their own wagons
meet them.</p>

<p>Ninian Sharp was disgusted. He was tired, his
head ached, and he had anticipated no such &#8220;one
horse&#8221; village as this. &#8220;Why, I thought it was your
post town and all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is. And a very pretty place by daylight,
save that they don&#8217;t irrigate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which means there isn&#8217;t a spear of grass within the
town limits, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Almost as bad. But now we&#8217;ll change places, if you
please. I&#8217;ve been to Marion several times with my
father and once since&#8211;since he went away, with Samson.
There! They&#8217;re taking Scruff out of the car and
you must ride him. I know the way. It&#8217;s only a mile,
about, to the hotel. Of course, there&#8217;s a lodging-house
nearer, right by this station, indeed, but the hotel&#8217;s
much nicer. You&#8217;ll get a better bed there, and we&#8217;d
best go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather sleep on the ground than walk a mile.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall do neither. Didn&#8217;t you hear me say
we&#8217;ve changed places now? I&#8217;m so near home I am at
home and I&#8217;m&#8211;the captain. Obey orders, sir, and
mount Scruff&#8217;s back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was too weary to protest and too ill. Subject to
acute neuralgia, he was, like plenty of people, rather
less courageous when he was in pain than at other times.
Besides, now there was something of that decision
in Jessica&#8217;s tone which sick people find restful, and he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
quietly threw one leg across Scruff&#8217;s back and let the
girl do as she pleased.</p>

<p>This was to start forward over the unpaved, unlighted
street at a swift unbroken run, which Scruff
had some work to equal; but the speed brought them
promptly to a wooden &#8220;tavern,&#8221; from one window
of which there gleamed a solitary oil lamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Horrors! Antonio described a ranch called Desolation,
or something like that, and I reckon we&#8217;ve arrived,&#8221;
lamented the reporter, jolted into fresh distress
by the burro&#8217;s trot.</p>

<p>Jessica laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait. Be patient, dear man. Within five minutes
you&#8217;ll be sleeping on a clean, sweet bed, and when you
wake up in the morning it will be to a fine breakfast,
a perfect day, and&#8211;Sobrante!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she tapped on the window and called:</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there! Sobrante folks! Open the door,
quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>A head was thrust out of another window, further
along the narrow porch, and a sleepy voice asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you say? Who wants<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do! Jessica Trent, from Sobrante. But last,
right from Los Angeles city. Please be quick!&#8221;</p>

<p>In less time than seemed possible, for such a drowsy
person to reach it, the door was flung wide and there
rushed out upon the porch a man and a woman, who
both seized Jessica at one time and in their effort to
embrace her succeeded in hugging each other. Whereupon
the landlady flung her stalwart husband aside and
caught the little girl in her arms, to carry her within.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>&#8220;Oh! but this is the darling home again! And is it
good news you&#8217;ve brought, my dear? Ah! by the shining
of your bonny eyes one can see that plain. Light
up, Aleck! Light up! How can we have such darkness
when the bairn is safe back? And begging pardon,
lassie, who is this yon?&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica presented her friend and added, quickly:</p>

<p>&#8220;Only for him I could never have done that business,
Janet, Aleck. And it is done. Everybody<span style='white-space: nowrap'>&#8211;&#8211;</span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the countryside knows it already, Jessica Trent.
It&#8217;s ringing with it, as it rung with the story of a
wave little lass who set out alone and unfriended, save
for one old man, to clear her father&#8217;s memory of a stain
some ne&#8217;er-do-well had dared to splash it with; and how
the old man broke his leg and lost the bairn; and, losing,
she fell into wiser hands and all, and all. Why,
the &#8216;boys&#8217; are here long before sun up; hours before
mailtime, to get the latest news. Ah! it&#8217;s proud is all
this land because of you, my wee bit bairnie!&#8221;</p>

<p>Again was Jessica caught and kissed till her breath
was gone; but released she demanded, and with disappointment
in her tone:</p>

<p>&#8220;So the news is no news, and does my mother, too,
know all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn&#8217;t the sweet lady read the papers that the &#8216;boys&#8217;
have carried, loping to break their necks! Ah, lassie,
&#8217;twill be an ovation you&#8217;ll get when once they sight
your bonny head shining on the sandy branch road!&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica turned toward Ninian Sharp with the first
feeling of anger she had ever had toward him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>&#8220;The papers? Your <i>Lancet</i>, I suppose. But you
knew, you knew how much I wanted to surprise my
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even so. But could you expect a man to keep back
such fine &#8216;copy&#8217; from his office? If you did, or if I
could, somebody else, like <i>The Gossip</i>, would have got
ahead of us. It was public property, my little Lady,
and private interests, or fancies, always yield to the
great public. We&#8217;ll discuss this further to-morrow.
To-night I&#8217;d like to see the bed you promised.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica caught the hand of her weary friend and
begged:</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me. I forgot. And I suppose that the
very feeling which made you so kind and faithful to
us, strangers, made you faithful to&#8211;to that horrid
old <i>Lancet</i>, too. Now Janet, you are to give Mr. Sharp
your very nicest bed and breakfast, for he is tired
and suffering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis ready this instant. &#8217;Tis always ready, lassie,
though few come nowadays, to use it. This way, sir.
After I show him I&#8217;ll come for you, Lady Jess.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jessica had not overpraised the neatness and comfort
of this out-of-the-way hostelry, and Ninian Sharp slept
dreamlessly till joyous voices outside his window roused
him to the fact that morning and hunger had arrived
together. Remembering, too, the long ride that lay
before him and the necessity of finding a horse for it,
he rose and hastily dressed. He had lost his neuralgic
pains and his spirits were again such as Jessica had always
seen him show. She, too, was up and waiting,
and it looked as if her ovation had begun; for she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span>
already the center of an admiring group yet held closest
to the side of a big ranchman, grizzled and rugged, but
beaming upon her and all the rest like an incarnate joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Samson, Samson, here he is! Mr. Sharp, dear Mr.
Sharp, this is my biggest &#8216;boy&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh! Glad to see you, little one. &#8216;Looks like
you&#8217;d be quite a man when you get growed up,&#8217;&#8221;
quoted the joker, giving Samson&#8217;s hand a cordial grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on! Come on! You&#8217;re the lad for us!
Well, sir, you do me proud. You do Sobrante proud.
You do all the world proud, and that&#8217;s my sentiment
to a t-i-o-n, sir! Breakfast&#8217;s ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Ninian, he&#8217;s brought&#8211;my mother has sent
you the horse that nobody else has ridden since my
father did. Nimrod, the swiftest, gentlest thoroughbred
that anybody ever rode.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sent him for me? Why, how could she know that
we were coming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t she?&#8221; asked Samson. &#8220;Him and
John Benton was over yesterday, but to-day it was my
turn. One of us has been every day since the captain
left Sobrante; and since the good news arrived there&#8217;s
always been a led horse for you, sir. Would have
been till the day of judgment, too, if you hadn&#8217;t struck
us afore. Reckon you aren&#8217;t acquainted with our little
settlement, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckon I wasn&#8217;t, but I&#8217;m beginning to be. My!
What a magnificent animal. And it solves the difficulty
of finding a mount out to the ranch. I&#8217;m not
much of a horseman, though. I don&#8217;t know but I&#8217;d
better stick to Scruff and leave Nimrod to Lady Jess.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>Samson wheeled around and eyed the stranger, curiously.
Then he advanced and held out his hand again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake, Sharp. You&#8217;re a man, even if you do live
in a city, and the first one I ever met who hailed from
such a place and didn&#8217;t think he knew it all. You&#8217;ll do.
And you can ride. A baby could, that creatur&#8217;. If
you can&#8217;t stick I&#8217;ll hold you on. Now, breakfast, I
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was Jessica&#8217;s chance, and before they sat down
to the bounteous meal which Janet had been hours in
preparing she managed to draw Ninian aside and whisper
a request, to which he nodded prompt assent. So
nobody but they two knew what was meant when, as
the three mounted and were about to ride away, she
asked Samson:</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know the trail to El Desierto?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know a pisen serpent? What in the name of
reason put such a forsaken hole into your head on this
joyful occasion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind what, and never mind speech-making,
dear old fellow. I have to call at El Desierto on my
way to Sobrante and would like to know the shortest
road.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she&#8211;has she got a little &#8216;touched&#8217; down there
in your City of Angels and Scamps, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Samson, am I still the captain, or am I not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain, I salute. Ride on! You, Aleck, hitch up
a board and take that trunk of Miss Trent&#8217;s to her
country seat, and be quick about it. Hurray! I&#8217;m so
happy I&#8217;m looney! Here&#8217;s for El Desierto and no
questions asked. Hurray!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span><a id='link_21'></a>CHAPTER XXI<br /><span class='h2fs'>BACK AT SOBRANTE</span></h2>

<p>For an hour and a half they rode swiftly along
a comparatively level trail, though to Ninian Sharp&#8217;s
untrained eyes there was no road visible. How Samson
managed to pick his way so undeviatingly over
the dried herbage and sandy soil was a mystery; but
neither the guide nor Jessica found anything strange in
this. Those who live in wide solitudes grow keen
of sight and hearing, and there were tiny roughnesses
here and there which clearly marked to these experienced
ranch people where other feet had passed that
way.</p>

<p>Presently the roughness increased, and the trail
climbed steadily toward a mesa, which seemed to the
reporter but ten rods distant, yet was, in reality, as
many miles.</p>

<p>&#8220;We turn here, captain. Shall I ride ahead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Samson, but slowly. Scruff&#8217;s been so idle all
these weeks and grown so lazy he&#8217;ll hardly move.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll get over that as soon as he meets up with the
tackers. My, but they&#8217;ve led Aunt Sally a life! And
taken more medicine than was due &#8217;em during the
natural course of their lives. Say, Sharp, do you enjoy
picra?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never tasted the stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And &#8216;never too late to mend.&#8217; Here, take this vial,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
I present it to you with my compliments. With the
captain&#8217;s respect. With the good will of the whole
outfit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, beg pardon, I have no use for&#8211;picra.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t delude yourself. You&#8217;ll have to have it,
outside or in. I&#8217;m a friend. I give you this bottle.
Then, when Aunt Sally appears with her little dish
and spoon, produce this from your pistol pocket and
knock her plumb speechless. It&#8217;s your only salvation.
Now or never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Thanks. A case of forearmed, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. Now&#8211;there she is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Samson rose in his stirrups and pointed forward
with his crop. Upon a barren, wide-stretching tableland
stood a cluster of adobe huts. Behind them a
clump of live oaks, beside them a sandy, curving streak,
an arroyo, lighter in hue than the surrounding soil, but
parched and dry as if part of the desert itself; behind
them, three mighty, jagged, upward-pointing rocks.</p>

<p>&#8220;There she is. The weirdest, lonesomest, God-for-sakenest
habitation that fools ever made or lived in,
quoted the joker, giving Samson&#8217;s hand a cordial grasp.
Hello! What&#8217;s up captain?&#8221;</p>

<p>For Jessica had also caught sight of the desolate
homestead and, having too low stirrups for standing,
had sprung to Scruff&#8217;s back and poised thus on his
saddle, was straining her eager, excited gaze toward
the distant El Desierto.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dream! The spot! For once he told the truth!
Follow, follow me, quick!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>&#8220;Land of love! She has gone queer, and that&#8217;s a
fact. Does the mite think that there little donkey can
outrun your horse or mine? After her, stranger, lest
she do some harm to herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ninian smiled softly and touched Nimrod lightly,
and in a moment all three were again racing over the
mesa, side by side, the girl foremost, and the men
reining in their horses lest they should forestall her
of the goal to which she aspired. The reporter, as
eager and almost as wise as she, but good Samson completely
in the dark and growing a trifle angry over the
fact.</p>

<p>When they came up to it the place seemed utterly
deserted. The doors opened to the touch and in all but
one of the three small buildings the windows were
broken. The third was in better repair and was evidently
sometimes still used by somebody. There was
a bed, or cot, spread with blankets, a coal-oil stove,
some canned meats and biscuits, and a well-wrapped
gun.</p>

<p>But Jessica&#8217;s attention passed these details over.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rocks! They are the very same as in my dream
and he told me of them when he drew the map. Is that
in your pocket, Mr. Sharp? Oh! is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221; He drew it forth and held it so that Samson,
too, could see.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come! In the dream there was a little cave beneath
the rocks and in the cave a box. You know it,
Samson, the black tin box in which the valuable papers
were kept. We could find it nowhere, mother nor I,
but I shall find it here and in it&#8211;oh! in it&#8211;there will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
be that title deed! You look, &#8216;boys,&#8217; I can&#8217;t, I tremble
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Samson forced his great length downward and inward
under the bowlders and found, as Jessica had felt
sure, a small but perfectly dry and well-protected cave.
The rocks and live oaks screened it from the sight
of those who did not know it existed, and it would
never have been suspected that there was aught but
solid ground beneath those jagged stones.</p>

<p>The horses and Scruff were willing to stand without
tying, and Ninian was, in any case, too excited now to
have remembered them. He saw that Lady Jess was
trembling, indeed, and trembled himself. If this
should prove a disappointment, how would she bear it?</p>

<p>But it was not to be that. From the little cave there
presently issued a mighty shout. That is it would have
been mighty had the space been large enough to give it
vent. As it was, it came like the subdued roar of a
wild animal, and it was almost surprising to see the
soles of Samson&#8217;s boots emerge from the opening instead
of furry feet.</p>

<p>When he had crawled outward so far that he could
lift himself upright, the sailor leaped so high that Ninian
felt as if he were the one who had gone &#8220;queer&#8221;
instead of Jessica, suspected. But this reason was
obvious; for there in his hand was the veritable black
tin box familiar to the girl from her earliest memory,
and seen often enough by the herder to be instantly
recognized.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>When, at last, the box was in her own hands Jessica
became very quiet, though her voice still trembled as
she said:</p>

<p>&#8220;This belongs to my mother. It is for her to
open it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, captain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so, Jessica. If the deed for which she looked
were not there it would be but a fresh distress to her.
You look. It is your interest as well as hers, and if it
is not there you can save her, at least, one disappointment
on this day of your return.&#8221;</p>

<p>The opinions of her two friends prevailed; and, since
they had no key, Samson&#8217;s great knife forced the lock,
and stored within were papers and vouchers of great
value to Sobrante, which the faithless manager had
carried away for his own purposes.</p>

<p>The deed? Ah, yes. There it lay at the very bottom
of the pile, and Jessica knew it at once for the
queer paper which her father had shown her on the
night before his death.</p>

<p>For a time she could only weep over it and caress it,
remembering the dear hands which had held it before
her, and the unforgotten voice which had explained
its value and all about the necessary &#8220;recording&#8221; which
must be made. Then she rallied, remembering, also,
that other precious parent, alive and waiting for her
and it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep you the box, Samson. I, myself, must keep
and carry this.&#8221;</p>

<p>She fastened it within her blouse and kept one hand
upon it all the rest of the way. A brief and happy way,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
which ended in a mother&#8217;s arms and in the wild welcome
of every dweller at Sobrante. And when the
mother&#8217;s arms set their recovered treasure free for a
moment there were all the &#8220;boys&#8221; ready and waiting to
seize and carry her from point to point, telling how
careful had been each one&#8217;s stewardship and how they
would never let her go again. Never.</p>

<p>As for Ninian Sharp he did not recognize himself
in the hero they all made of him, nor did even Aunt
Sally presume to offer him, so wonderful a man, a
nauseous dose. But she was overheard to remark to
Wun Lung, who had also joined the company unforbidden
by his arch enemy:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do believe, Wun Lungy, that if ever that there
handsome young man should go and get married I&#8217;d
set him up in my fifty-five thousand five hundred and
fifty-five piece bedquilt. I did lay out to bequeath it to
Jessica, but, la! I can piece her another, just as willin&#8217;
as not. What you say, Wun Lungy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I slay, fool woman!&#8221;</p>

<p>For a time joy and surprise turned Ned and Luis
speechless; yet they were sent to bed late that night,
each hugging a sharp-edged train of tin cars and
breathing, &#8220;Choo! choo!&#8221; as if a railway were a common
sight instead of an unknown one.</p>

<p>But there came at last a quiet hour for mother and
child, when they sat in close embrace, telling all that
had befallen each during the days of separation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! if dear Ephraim were only here, mother! I
said it should not be a month before that title deed
was found, and the month will not be up until to-morrow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span>
Poor Ephraim! It was bitter hard to leave him
alone in that hospital, well-liked and cared for though
he is. If it hadn&#8217;t been for him I could never have
gone. And the &#8216;boys&#8217; would have made such a hero
of him. Even as they did of Mr. Sharp. Can&#8217;t you
guess how proud they&#8217;d have been of him, mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Mrs. Trent did not reply, Jessica looked up
quickly and saw that dear face so near her own still
clouded by a shadow of trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, mother! What is it? You look as if you
were not perfectly, absolutely happy, and yet how can
you be else&#8211;to-night?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, darling, I am happy. So glad and thankful
that I cannot put it into words. But Ephraim? My
darling, at present, not for some days, if I were you I
would not talk about Ephraim. You will be happier
so. No. He is alive and getting well, so far as I
know. There has been no later news than yours.
Don&#8217;t look so alarmed. Only this: the &#8216;boys&#8217; have
taken some queer notion about our &#8216;Forty-niner,&#8217; and
so I say he is probably happier just where he is to-night
than if he were back at Sobrante.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! mother! Another mystery? and about such a
simple, honest, splendid old fellow as my Ephraim?
Well, never mind. I seem to be sent into the world to
solve other people&#8217;s &#8216;mysteries,&#8217; and I&#8217;ll solve his.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eventually she did. But how and when cannot be
told here. This is a story which must be related another
time. But for the time Jessica was happy and all
went well.</p>

<p class='c'>THE END.</p>
